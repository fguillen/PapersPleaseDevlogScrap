# Papers, please Â· The devlog

A scraper to collect all the articles Lucas Pope wrote on his Papers, please devlog.

Lucas Pope is an incredible talented indie gamedev. Analysing his work building Papers, please is an exercise for me to try to get into his mind, with the hope I can get some inspiration for my own game development endeavors. I built this scraper to read in a comfortable way all the articles Lucas wrote on his devlog.
