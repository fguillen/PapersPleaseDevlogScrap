<br><hr>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Old Stuff</b></span><br><br>Ever taken an international flight to a foreign country and felt nervous passing through the immigration checkpoint? <i>Papers, Please</i> aims to turn that around and put you in the role of immigration inspector. Instead of working in a nice modern airport booth, you're assigned to the Ministry of Admission in the war-torn dystopian nation of Arstotzka. <br><br>The glorious and free country of Arstotzka has just ended a 6-year war with neighboring Kolechia and reclaimed its rightful half of the border town, Grestin. Your job is to control the flow of people entering the Arstotzkan side of Grestin from Kolechia. Among the throngs of immigrants and visitors looking for work are hidden smugglers, spies, and terrorists. Using only the documents provided by travelers and MoA's primitive computer dispatch system you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.<br><br>Ok, that's the setup. Some elements of this are pretty similar to my other game, "The Republia Times". I'm a sucker for dystopian settings.<br><br>Let's have a mockup:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BhXlv19.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Lookin a bit empty at this point. The enemy country is on the left and your country is on the right. The top of the screen is the actual border checkpoint and the bottom is inside your booth. Travelers will queue on the top left, pass through your inspection building, then on to enter Arstotzka on the top right. People will enter the inspection booth, you click on their documents and vet them by looking for discrepancies, then you either approve their entry visa or deny their crossing (with or without prejudice).<br><br>A little closer:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6OTH0NO.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I haven't completely worked out the precise mechanics yet, but it's probably going to boil down to inspecting all the documents and trying to find any two pieces of information that don't match. For example, if a traveler's passport says they weigh 70kgs, but their current measured weight is 74kgs, you have reason to be suspicious. Highlighting these two pieces of information in the UI will open up further options. In this case, you now need to run a metal detector over the guy or even strip search him. Turns out he just gained some weight so he's clear to pass. Enjoy your time in Arstotzka.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Motivation</b></span><br>The last few games I've worked on have been programming-first, art-second. This time I'm going to try to focus on the art. I'm envisioning lots of cool little pixel portraits and documents and not so many technical challenges. A big part of the game is the traveler portraits so I want to spend a fair amount of time creating those. I'm also considering a system to create face variations from my initial drawings. I guess that would be a technical task so we'll see.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>More About the Art</b></span><br>I don't have any formal art training so I'm just gonna copy what I see elsewhere. One thing I like about some of the better pixel-art games is the limited palette. Instead of choosing a global palette though, I'm going to try limiting individual objects or backgrounds to ~3 shades. That's not a hard rule and if it doesn't look good I'm flexible. You can already see a few places in the mockup like that. <br><br>For the initial version of the game I'm going to do everything in mid-res pixel art. Pixel art is just way easier, faster, and more enjoyable for me. When it comes to most commercial games however I think pixel art may not be a good choice. It works great for indies and people close to the scene, but my feeling is that most mainstream players prefer a smoother non-pixelated look. I've made some rough experiments with converting the small character portraits to full vector images and they don't look half bad. If I decide to turn this in to a commercial game it's possible I'll do that for all the art. I kinda did the same thing with Helsing's Fire and that turned out ok.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Technical</b></span><br>I've got a really sweet custom C++ engine built on SDL just sitting here but I'm planning to use HaxeNME for this project. I've done 2 flash games before and really like the fact that they're so easy for others to play. HaxeNME looks interesting and is a slight hedge on this game getting good enough to sell as a native app. Actually I'm a full-time indie developer so I'm really hoping to sell the game when it's done. If it's any good. Next point..<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>DevLog</b></span><br>I've made a bunch of games but never kept a devlog before. I'll do my best to keep this thread updated with screenshots and builds. I don't expect the entire game to take more than a few <del>weeks</del> months to develop. <del>I'll probably edit that sentence out in a few months</del>. Any feedback is appreciated.<br><br><div align="center">______________________________________________________________________<br><br>There are updates throughout the thread, but I'll just put this here:<br><br><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><a href="http://dukope.com/#ppl" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Get the Latest Build &lt;&lt;</a><br></span></b><br>(Currently in beta so missing some stuff)<br><br>______________________________________________________________________<br>

              <blockquote class="blockquote">Haha, nice concept. So the whole game will take place in one setting then?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>More or less, yeah. There will be some activity in the border checkpoint area at the top, but most of the focus will be in the booth.<br><br>If the inspection gameplay works out ok, I'm also thinking of incorporating the contrary mode where you work as a smuggler/spy-chief/terrorist-leader for the enemy state. You'd be assigned tasks ("smuggle 20kg of bullets"), recruit agents to pass through the border, set them up with fake documents, hide contraband on their body (you know where), and send them through the checkpoint. I guess that would take place in a different setting.<br><br>A possible extension of that is to have player-created smugglers in the pool of travelers passing through player-controlled inspectors. And THAT... might make a half-decent play-by-day multiplayer game.<br>

</blockquote>
<br>Hah, thanks! No rotoscoping, I just drew those frames by hand. With so few pixels it's pretty easy to iterate on. Now that you mention it though, rotoscopy is exactly the look I'm going for.  I kept thinking "natural" animation but what I want is that classic low-res rotoscoping feel.

</blockquote>
<br>I was thinking it best to stick to 16:9, but after seeing your mockup I'm not so sure anymore. 3:2 gives a lot more room to work with. I probably don't know enough about what kinds of documents the game will include to decide right now but I'm gonna experiment with 960x640 as you suggest. Thank you for the ideas! I absolutely don't mind you editing the mockup and I really appreciate the help.<br><br>Btw, this is exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy. I'll take a limited resolution, palette, or game mechanic over unlimited freedom any day. Given Pioneers resolution and (awesome) palette, I'll bet you're the same way <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

</blockquote>
<br>Thanks spolvid. This game will probably have a similar flavor so I hope you enjoy it too.<br><br>Slightly updated layout with taller resolution:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aS4gS.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Eigen's suggestion prompted me to keep experimenting with the mockup. With a 3:2 aspect, there's room to rearrange the inspection booth a bit and give the doc inspection area more space. Each document can be maximum 150x215 and 2 documents can be visible at any time. Teletex query results, the audio transcript, and the rule book will behave just like documents. This'll be nice for consistency and having the docs side-by-side makes it easier to find and highlight discrepancies. 150x215 is not a lot of space but my feeling is that the docs shouldn't be too complicated so hopefully it works out.<br><br>Closeup:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vqdTc.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>From left to right there's a clock, scale readout, microphone, computer screen, and notebook. Not sure what to do with the clock just yet but there'll probably be some time component to the gameplay. Scale shows the person's weight, mic will show the audio transcript document when clicked, computer screen will show the teletex document when clicked, and the notebook will show the rule book when clicked. <br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Rule Book</b></span><br>In order to establish the baseline regulations for which documents and information a traveler must have to enter, there's a rule book. This lists things like "Traveler must have an entry permit", "Traveler must be over 18", etc. If a rule is being broken, it can be highlighted for further options. One example would be the "Traveler must be over 18" rule. If you inspect their passport and calculate their age to be &lt; 18, you can select both their passport birthdate and the age rule. This will highlight the discrepancy and open up a teletex query or a question you can ask the traveler.

              Thanks for the feedback everyone!<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">* What if I allow everyone into the country? Are there any penalties for doing that? If so, what are they.<br>* What happens if I don't allow anyone into the country? I mean a total blockade.<br>* As the player, what is the end goal? I mean, at what point is the game considered completed.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I think the gameplay will probably be divided into days with daily quotas. I'd say your goal is to process people as quickly as possible and not make any mistakes. There'll be a proper narrative and story arc to tie the days together. The low level day-to-day stuff is random within parameters; the story is scripted.<br><br>If you don't let anyone through, you'd probably get fired after a few days. If you let everyone through, you'll be responsible for spy/terrorist/smuggler activity. I'm thinking to show performance reports at the end of each day to let you know how you're doing. Some results will be more immediate. For example, a terrorist suicide bomber may detonate onscreen immediately after he passes through your booth. Bad lookin out.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">It would also be interesting if the player has to decide whether the picture on the passport is of the same person as the one standing in line. <br>For even more complexity make the passport picture always appear younger and with a different haircut.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Actually this is exactly what I'm planning. Even with the mockup I found it fun to dart my eyes back and forth at the passport photo and the dude's face. Same person? Possibly... A proper immigration inspector maintains a suspecting, skeptical eye. Changing up the photos with different glasses/hats/clothes/age should keep it interesting. Which leads nicely to...<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Wanted Criminals</b></span><br>The computer terminal, when inspected, will display multiple screens that you can flip between. One of these screens will contain a photo list of known spies/terrorists/criminals/smugglers. As you vet each person, don't forget to compare their face against the current bulletin photos. If you find a match, highlight their face and the photo to reveal an "arrest this punk" option.<br><br>Some kind of "urgent bulletin" system built on this could create pretty cool Bourne moments too. You may get an urgent bulletin and expect the criminal to show up (in disguise) within the next few minutes or not at all.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Forged Documents</b></span><br>Along with a list of basic regulations, the rule book will also contain samples of many common documents and passport covers from all surrounding countries. It'll be up to you to cross reference these samples to make sure the traveler's documents aren't forgeries. What I like about this is that after a few days, you'll have memorized how the most common docs should look and won't need to waste precious time referencing the rule book.

              <blockquote class="blockquote">I also threw some documents around, and I personally dont like how the documents move out from "under the desk view" to the open area.

</blockquote>
<br>Well damn. That's one of the things I was quite happy with. You don't have to drop the document first before seeing it on the desk. Makes quicklooks easy and enables placing it right the first time if you decide to inspect it. I thought it was kinda cool how it dragged straight across but I concede now that maybe it's a little weird.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>You Look Honest</b></span><br>New build:<br><a href="http://pope.jeffsys.net/play.php?g=ppl" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VjkVe.png" alt="" border="0"></a><br><br>I've added initial versions of the rulebook, audio transcript, and telex dispatch. I've also hard-coded a traveler so you can poke around in his documents a bit. There's nothing to do except that actually. Haven't gotten to the part where you approve/deny his entry.<br><br>This is early days so it's all very rough. There's no story, interesting accouterments, or fun. A lot of stuff is incomplete and confusing which I realize is a bad introduction to the mechanics. The final version will build up gradually and introduce these concepts with glorious clarity. For now, study the rulebook first.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Challenge!</b></span><br>The traveler in this build has 4 errors in his documents.

<br>Haha. "If in doubt, keep em out." Indeed.<br><br>Played around with some basic animations for walking up to/away from the booth.

<br>Well the shutter is a means to explain the shadowing.

</blockquote>
<br>That's an awesome idea and a great reason to keep them. I can add a hand banging against the shutter if you take too long to open it or close it without giving them their documents back.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Also...These look mostly right and all but I think I see two other things wrong:<br><span style="font-size: 2pt; line-height: 1.3em;">-His passport expired three years ago<br>-He's supposedly only about 6 months old according to the DoB<br></span><br>
</blockquote>
<br>The date format is 'year.month.day'. I'll have to make that somehow more clear in the game.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">You could have the shutters slam shut when someone tries to make a run for it, might add a little to the feeling of danger.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Heh. Another good idea. I was also thinking it'd be cool to have someone pull a gun on you in the booth if you deny their entry. Closing the shutters quickly would be a way to save yourself.

<br>Nothing except the inefficiency of it. On those traveling light (traveler with passport, entry permit, responses, appearance, and your rulebook) there are about 35 unique pieces of information. That's almost 600 unique fact pairs so it's gonna take some time to even click them all. And since not all facts are visible at once you'd need to periodically rearrange the documents. <br><br>Much easier to just scan the documents visually and highlight where you think there's an error.

<br>Just some artificial gating since there's no other reason to highlight yet. In the end, the denied stamp will always be available and highlighting errors will allow further actions like in one of the animated gifs I posted.<br><br>I agree it definitely needs some audio.

              <blockquote class="blockquote">Really cool game, it was fun and addictive from what I played.  Using the huge stamp felt so cool, and I liked how you could stamp the passport as many times as you want just for fun.<br>

<br>Thanks.

Each type of error will lead to a short dialog interaction and in some cases the option to search their body or send a telex. <br><br>It may also prompt the applicant to submit more documents. For instance, if they don't have an entry permit and you ask them about it, they could say something like "Whoops, here it is." and put it on the counter.<br><br>For this dialog system I'm going to try to categorize responses into different "personalities" which would enable applicants to be dickheads, sympathetic, indifferent etc.<br><br><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;">Tracking Performance</span></b><br>One issue I haven't gotten to yet is how to show player performance. If the game is broken into days, there should be some stat thing that shows at the end of each day. I was recently thinking it might be cool to have this be a sort of flash-forward "Where are they now" summary for each traveler you dealt with.<br><br>As an example, if you let a smuggler through in error, it would give a small report like "[PICTURE] Anton Sarvoy: Arrested for smuggling. Detained and executed". Or hopefully it's something more positive. If you had mercy on someone with poor documentation: "[PICTURE] Alice Mitchells: Reunited with son. Gainfully employed." So these blurbs are from the far future, not just the next day. Might be kinda weird in that sense.<br><br><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;">On the other hand</span></b><br>I think some of an immigration inspector's anxiety comes from not knowing what happens to the immigrants they process every day. In <i>Papers Please</i> there will be immediately visible consequences in some cases (terrorist bomber). But in other cases the person will just pass through and you won't know what happened until the stats screen at the end of each day. Not sure if I want to try to capture that sense of not-knowing and show only minimal stats or treat it more like a game with detailed information on each immigrant.<br>

<br>This is perfect; way better than a stats screen. Definitely gonna do this.

Maybe your "score" will actually be your money. Some less-than-honest applicants can offer you money up front, or the promise to mail cash to you later in exchange for a quick approval. This'll give you some non-altrusitic incentive to let the bad ones through.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Progression</b></span><br>The money system could also nicely tie in to the overall progression. Let's say you receive a daily salary from the Ministry based on performance. Each day you lose a little money due to living expenses. Your current income represents your wealth bracket, of which there are several. The story and game progresses as you move up the brackets.

              Thanks for the feedback everyone.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">And a lady is missing her entry permit, but the game is telling me no correlation. Hmph. (Oh, her passport was expired too.)<br>
</blockquote>
<br>No correlation between which things? For a missing entry permit (for non-Arstotzkans only), you have to highlight the rule and the counter top. I'll fix the other stuff you mentioned. In the next build you'll be able to click the "Passport ISS field must be valid" to correlate with a wrong city.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">I believe that further in the development you should add document forgery errors (different typefaces, wrong paper etc.)<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I experimented with this but decided these sorts of changes are too subtle. Instead, documents will have official seals that may be forged incorrectly.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">How about marking discrepancies with a right click, that would get rid of the need for extra inspection mode.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I can do the right-click shortcut for native builds, but not flash. Maybe I'll have the space key toggle inspection mode to make it a little faster.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Some thoughts on the rule book. The corner to flip pages could be bigger, as big as possible in my opinion. There is a ribbon on the top left, this seems to be a browser-like "go back" function. It feels a bit strange to have in a book. I think it would be nicer (and more like an actual bookmark) to always be able to quickly get to the contents.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>You shouldn't have to flip pages too much but I agree the corner could be bigger. I made the bookmark more like a browser thinking it would be more convenient but I think you're right. I usually just end up clicking it a bunch to get back to the TOC anyways. I'll change it to just go to page one.

              <br><blockquote class="blockquote">What if ...<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I appreciate the detailed suggestion but there's a couple reasons why I don't think this is best.<br><br>I hate work as much as the next guy but in this case I'm not just being lazy <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0">. I intentionally designed this part of the game to be stark and simple. Basically, I want to add another facet to the primary (daytime) gameplay without too much distraction for the player.<br><br>My plan is to expand on a similar technique I used in Republia Times. In that case there was only a single sentence about the family each day but it served to humanize the player and make their daily decisions more difficult. I want to take that same effect and give it more weight. Not by defining the family more, but by providing more fine-grained influence over their wellbeing.<br><br>Although a single night screen from one day looks pretty stark, your family's status will change and progress throughout the game. If your uncle is sick too long without medicine he'll die. Or his medicine costs will go up each day. Or maybe your son's birthday is coming up and he wants a new toy. Skip your uncle's medicine for a day and you can afford the toy. Or, as you mention, a new apartment with lower rent/heating costs is available for a fee. The choices you make on this screen will have lasting effects and you'll need to be careful about how you spend your money.<br><br>About the hints from family members, there will be plenty of story and flavor elements coming from the immigrants themselves. I prefer to keep that stuff wed closely to the daily gameplay as opposed to putting it in the separate night screens.<br><br>Having said all that business, I'm not completely against more involved nightly updates. At this point I'm moving forward with this simple implementation. Later down the line it may become clear that something more complicated would benefit the game.

              Random stuff that's changed/updated recently:<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Speech Chat</b></span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9pUI9k6.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>I initially had solitary speech bubbles (visible upthread) that pop up for the dialog. The little back-and-forth at the beginning ended up being too slow and stunted with those bubbles so I changed it to more of a scrolling chat window. Flows much better although I'm not crazy about overlapping the face.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Goodbye Telex</b></span><br>In that pic you can also see that the Telex is gone from the console. I couldn't find a good use for it after adding the fingerprint system. In its place is the daily bulletin which you can reference at any time.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Daily Bulletin</b></span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4EAyiXR.png" alt="" border="0"><br>First bulletin in the game. These are waiting on your desk at the start of each day. Later bulletins will contain mugshots of wanted people. The Telex was going to have those but I think it fits better here.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Dialog</b></span><br>I've been writing a bunch of the generic question and response dialog recently. Initially I authored it to flow naturally with proper English grammar but the game lost much of its Eastern-European feel. Now I'm trying rougher, less fluent English and it's a little better:<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><i>"I'll stay for three months."</i></span> becomes <span style="color: purple;"><i>"I stay three months."</i></span><br><br>Pretty subtle but I was surprised at how the fluent English destroyed some of the mood. I hope this works better.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Action Buttons</b></span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eBAtr5v.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>These buttons will appear as the result of an interrogation. After highlighting an error in inspection mode only one option is available: Interrogate. Based on the entrant's response, one or more of these action buttons will appear. They'll stay in place until you click them or move on to the next entrant.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Giving Back</b></span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/P1IosNZ.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>Instead of just returning all the docs to the counter you now have to explicitly give them back. This'll allow confiscations and document trades later down the line.

</blockquote>
<br>There's a minimum number of people you have to process for each day. If the clock ends before this, you still need to finish out the remaining entrants (sans pay). I set it up like this so that story-critical entrants can be scripted per day and will match up with the daily bulletins. I'll try to explain this quota system in an early bulletin.

<br>I was wondering if the warning should mention the exact mistake.

<br>Hehe ok that's good to know. This is a little scary though because the first bulletin states matter-of-factly that you should only permit Arstotzkan citizens to enter due to a security alert.

The C++ engine is a collection of stuff I've built on and developed over the last 10 years or so. It sits atop SDL for multi-plat support and has the usual OpenGL engine features like scenes, audio, ui, etc. I like it a lot, but I think my days of maintaing custom engines are over so I chose Haxe/NME for this project.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@ sk2k</b></span><br>Old computers are the best computers.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@ Eigen</b></span><br>Thanks for having your girl check it out. A perspective like that is really helpful. The difficulty will scale up beyond the first few days but I'm definitely worried about getting that scaling right. One person's interminably slow is another's blinding fast. Maybe a difficulty setting is best. The game currently has the partial name errors she suggested, but not partial id number errors. I'll change it so only single digits can be off later on. Ditto with the seals. There's a library of slightly-off seals that come up randomly. When the game gets longer there'll be more chances to see these. About the passport expiration. Not sure what to do about that. I'll either not bring it up, or programmatically ensure that all passport expirations extend beyond the stay.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@ Baobab</b></span><br>Hehe.

About dialog trees, I'm sorry to say that I probably won't go there. From a development perspective, I don't like to write much dialog. And from a gamer perspective, I don't like to read much dialog. I think the game works better by making the motions more mechanical and less like a traditional dialog tree. At least it enhances the bureaucratic feel for me. I do like the idea about requesting a bribe though. I could fit that in with a drop-down button like the fingerprinting. The idea about the newspapers is also a good one. I've kinda rolled that idea around in my head for awhile. The newspaper headlines format is a great way to update the player without much reading. And finally, you're right about the passports. I'll definitely make them more varied since one of the main things people miss is the entrant's nationality. Not sure about color-coding their clothes but that's not outside consideration. <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><br>Thanks everybody for the comments and suggestions.

The basic pipeline is to create/edit/animate the sprite frames and save/export them as individual numbered pngs. Then comes <a href="http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker" target="_blank">TexturePacker</a> to put all the frames in one sprite sheet which the game uses. I tried lots of different sprite animation programs. Everything was recommended by somebody but since I'm on a mac, I couldn't try Graphics Gale, which many say is the best. <br><br><b><a href="http://pixenapp.com" target="_blank">Pixen</a></b><br>Pixen is a native Mac app with all the bullet-pointed features. I animated the basic traveler idle, walk, and run anims in Pixen a few months ago. When I went back a few days ago to do the rest of the animations I quickly got frustrated. Biggest problem is the export process which requires too many clicks to save out the individual pngs. Although I remember Pixen having onion skinning, I couldn't find the toggle again and gave up before spending much effort on it.<br><br><b><a href="http://www.aseprite.org" target="_blank">ASEPRITE</a></b><br>This app is clunky as hell, especially on OSX. But after learning some shortcuts it got much easier and I made good progress in spite of the completely wonky mouse movement. The load/save process is really smooth and I created the traveler climb and guard walk+idle animations fairly quickly. The onion skinning is nice. Unfortunately, I started running into problems with the explosion. My initial test came out terrible; mostly due to the limited tools available.<br><br><b>Photoshop</b><br>Realizing I'd need something cushier for the explosion pixeling, I moved over to Photoshop. Best to make the drawing easier and deal with whatever painful export process there was afterwards. Photoshop's animation system is pretty nice and I felt completely at home with the tools and layers here. PS Extended has onion skinning but I ended up doing ok without it. For exporting, there's a built-in "Export Layers" script but it's absolute shit.  Instead, I ended up saving for web to an animated gif, then extracting the frames using ImageMagick.<br><br><b><a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a></b><br>ImageMagick is a set of command-line tools for editing images. The main tool is called "convert" and lets you do all kinds of cool stuff. I've been using ImageMagick more and more recently and it's really come in handy on this project. For example, to take an animated gif, replace the background color with transparency, and export the frames as 32-bit png:<br><div class="codeheader">Code:</div>
<div class="code">convert -coalesce 'Boom.gif' -define png:format=png32 -channel rgba -fill none -draw "color 0,0 replace" border/Boom-%02d.png</div>Easy and fast.<br><br>Now that I've got the Photoshop workflow down, I'll probably stick with that for everything. In total, I spent around 6 hours yesterday on the explosion. I don't ever want to hand-pixel an explosion again. In-game, it's gone before you even notice it so I'm leaving it here for rubberneckage:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UqaZ6tE.gif" alt="" border="0">

<br>Ok, this part I get and that's a good point that I'm thinking about now. Making it a tranquilizer instead of a bullet takes care of the darkness so I may do that. But having such an action sequence is important for variety. My only concern isn't just to pack as many moral conundrums as possible into one game. I also want it to be fun to play.

              <span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Data Scripting</b></span><br>A few shots of the game's data scripts. 99% of the time I use XML for text-based data but I've branched out a little bit for this game. The amount of text data here has lead me to 2 alternatives: A simple indentation-based format and CSV exported from Numbers (exel for Mac).<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Days</b></span><br><div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lWNxhye.png" alt="" border="0"></div>
<br>This is the spreadsheet for all the per-day settings, traveler placement, news, rules, etc. Often you'll see spreadsheets like this with design logic and in this case I'm able to use the exported CSV data directly in the game. Working in a spreadsheet makes it much easier to follow and edit the progression. If this were XML I'd be constantly scrolling up and down to edit different sections. This kind of thing would probably be even easier with a custom tool but I decided that wasn't a good use of time for this project.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Travelers</b></span><br><div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jq1u87z.png" alt="" border="0"></div>
<br>Travelers are specified in a simple tab indention format, which is parsed into a node tree by the game. Syntax highlighting is my fav so I've also made a .language file for Sublime Text 2 to color each indented line. Using this simple format I can script each traveler with as much or as little specification as necessary. So in one case I may just give one guy a little bit of custom dialog when he's rejected; Everything else would be filled in randomly by the game. In another case I can force every detail (face, name, dialog, nationality, errors, etc) to build story threads.

<br>That's basically exactly right. At the moment I'm planning on ~30 days in the final story mode.

<br>Great idea about the tabs. It's too late for the beta build, but I can get that in the final. For now the game will always tell you exactly what you missed. Runners will only attempt to scale the wall if there are no guards on the left side. And I still feel the sniping is better as 1st person.

<br>Stamping everything was fun, but I felt just too much busywork (fine line, I know). I could make it optional (only required on the passport), but then it's confusing and you'd end up stamping everything anyways.

Going back to the alpha, I find it really frustrating to not know exactly what I missed when getting cited.

My ideal game is nothing but razor-sharp visuals.<br><br>BUT, after a week at GDC, considering everyone's input, and some more thought, I've decided to just stick with pixels for Papers Please. I guess the look has grown on me and I'm also not enamored with the vector alternatives. After all the game content is done I may re-evaluate the visuals but for now I'm happy with chunky pixels and low-res fonts.<br><br>Thanks to everybody (except traitor arne) for chiming in!

              <blockquote class="blockquote">Although, I found the citation penalties were too soft, you could actually just stamp everything without looking and still make $70-80 each day after deductions. Also, it turns out that paying penalties is as optional as the rent, and as a result I managed to get $815 in savings at the end of the 8 days, with all of my family "OK".<br>There wasn't even any consequences for doing so, the only people that went on to cause trouble had legitimate documents anyway...<br>

<br>This is a good point and something I never thought to try. I'll probably end the game after 5 penalties or something.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Finally, if you play the game through again and try refusing those Kolchians entry, it becomes pretty obvious that the game is forcing you to let one through...<br>

<br>I don't have to make the paperwork actually Kolechian, which might help. But really there are certain scripted things that will play out the same each time no matter what. A proper endless mode separate from the story mode should help with replayability.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Perhaps instead of deducting money continually, after 4-5 penalties the day ends prematurely due to the immigration inspector needing "counseling".<br>

<br>Yup, that sounds good.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Oh, and the end-of-day tally is buggy for me and a friend, and text appears over the button to go to the next day. Do you think that implementing a scrollbox for that would help?<br>

<br>I hate scroll boxes but I'll figure something out. Maybe drop to a smaller font if there are too many items.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">And last thing! Will there be hotkeys to easily navigate through documents?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I'm not too crazy about keyboard shortcuts and I'm not even sure how that would work to navigate documents. I've thought about simplifying this aspect of the game a couple times, but shuffling things around is a pretty critical element of game's mechanics.

              <span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Sniping</b></span><br>(Ignore the double cursor. My only LICEcap complaint)<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gYlpbIg.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I wrestled for a while with how to handle the sniping. There were a brief few microseconds when I thought to cut it. Those moments passed without incident and now we're left with this.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The Problem</b></span><br>The problem is that sniping with a mouse is way too easy. Previously I suggested it might change from a cross-hair to an aim-line or some other silly thing to increase the difficulty. Obviously that's a terrible idea but I still wanted to make it harder.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Sorted It</b></span><br>So this is my solution. The sniping is still easy. What's hard is getting the gun. It's not just about moving your cursor up to the top any more. You have to be fast. In order to access a gun, you first need a key. You'll get these through the course of the story. Once you've got a key, it sits on your desk wherever you put it, buried under the papers, unused. When the moment strikes, you'll need to find the key on your desk, unlock the gun drawer using the key, select the gun, then shoot the runner/trespasser/enemy. If it sounds like a pain in the ass that's because it is. It uses the same standard interface of paper shuffling and drag and drop, but with an extreme time limit. The level of panic is just right. By the time you get the gun out, there's only a second or two to aim and shoot before the grenade is thrown.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Armaments</b></span><br>There'll be just two guns, unlocked as the game progresses:<br><br><b>Tranquilizer rifle</b><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>3 rounds</li>
<li>less precise aiming</li>
<li>non-lethal drop in one hit (death animation above is wrong, it'll be bloodless)</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Sniper rifle</b><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>2 rounds</li>
<li>precise reticule</li>
<li>kills in one hit (bloody)</li>
</ul>
<br>The tranquilize gun comes first so you'll always have the option for non-lethal force.

</blockquote>
<br>Gotcha. Thanks for the info guys. I can see now that the leap at this moment from just stamping to being gated by inspection is too much. Citations and bulletin hints or not. Gonna put some more thought into how I can lower this barrier, smooth out this bump, and nail this metaphor.

              <span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Suddenly, Mods</b></span><br><br>If you've poked around in any of the beta's asset directories, you may know that all the game's assets are editable. Part of this is because Haxe/NME doesn't have an asset packaging system built in. Part of it is because I thought it would be cool if people could see how the game was set up.<br><br>While I never planned it, people have already started modding the game. This is a weird feeling for a game creator; especially when the game isn't done yet. There are some cool mods and some tasteless ones. Given the game's subject matter, this isn't surprising.<br><br>For the latest beta, I decided to address the issue. There were two options:<br><br>    <b>1.</b> Lock down the assets and prevent modding<br>    <b>2.</b> Support mods properly<br><br>I first implemented #1. That meant writing a build process to bundle/encrypt the assets and an in-game module to load/decrypt them. Haxe/NME made this amazingly easy and it really drove home the power of the language and tools.<br><br>I was pretty set with that when I came to my senses. Once the assets are out (as in the previous betas), it makes no sense to suddenly lock them down. It's a dick move, even. If I liked a game enough to spend my time modding it, I'd be pretty pissed if the next build disabled mods. Even if they were unofficial. I got my start in games with Quake mods and have some understanding of the effort and devotion that goes into modding.<br><br>Ok, so I decided #2 was a better choice in the end. At least for the pre-release builds.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Proper Support</b></span><br><br>Adding proper mod support wasn't that hard. There are 3 important things in my opinion:<br><br><b>1. Make them easy to distribute</b><br>Again, Haxe/NME pulled through here. There's a great exsiting api to extract zip files in Haxe. Using that lets modders zip up their asset directory into one nice .ppmod file that's easy to download. A .ppmod can by played by saving it next to PapersPlease.exe and drag+dropping it onto the executable.<br><br><b>2. Don't require overwriting original assets</b><br>The currently available mods are basically just a zip file of the entire beta, including the exe and all (edited) assets. This is wasteful and unsafe. I know I'm less likely to run a strange exe than I am to run an asset-only mod. Working over the original files is also a painful way to develop a mod and it's better to have a set of "override" assets instead. This allows including only the edited assets in a mod, which increases the likelihood that it'll work across multiple versions of the game.<br><br><b>3. Assign visible credit</b><br>This is the most important for me and there are two parts. First, it has to be clear that I didn't create the modded content. This is especially true when someone makes a tasteless mod. I don't want people to make a connection when seeing one of those and "Created by Lucas Pope" on the title screen. Second, good mods are a lot of work. If someone puts in the time and effort to make a mod, I want them to get credit. When running the latest beta, the game displays the mod name/author on the title screen and links to the author's website.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Reaction</b></span><br><br>We'll see. Even with a more complete modding system, it takes a few additional steps to create a mod now. Some people are already complaining about this so I guess you can't win sometimes.<br><br>Hopefully a few good mods come out of this, but for now I'm turning my focus back to finishing the game.

<br>An interesting thing I found very early is that the more errors an entrant has, the easier it is. The beta is currently limited to at-most one error per entrant. As you guys have noticed that makes it too predictable so I'm changing it to handle this case better. Documents revealed later may have errors in the final version.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Beta 0.5.13</b></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><a href="http://dukope.com#ppl" target="_blank"><b>GRAB IT HERE</b></a></span><br><br>Just a few bug fixes.<br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li> No new content.</li>
<li>  Show helpful error when trying to run without enough OpenGL.</li>
<li>  Fixed some issues with continuing a game in progress.</li>
<li>  Fixed "Invalid News0" citation message.</li>
<li>  Fixed crash when continuing from day 9.</li>
<li>  Fixed double-detain bug on scripted entrants.</li>
<li>  Corrected citation penalty amount text.</li>
<li>  Removed Jorji and made day 3 a much more casual-friendly experience.</li>
<li>  Just kidding. It seems the last fix worked. No more changes to day 3.</li>
</ul>
<br>There was one major issue I wanted to fix with this build. On some people's machines, the rendering is totally screwed up and the game eventually crashes. Turns out it was related to missing OpenGL drivers. The game now prints a useful error message in this case.<br><br>Hopefully there's nothing majorly wrong with this build as I'm hoping to move off the beta and start the push for final release.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Endless Mode</b></span><br><br>An endless mode is something I've been mulling since the beginning, and it's a common request.

The days/entrants/rules/events will be randomly generated with some basic progression. I may or may not include the night-time money management here. Will have to test it out. This mode also might include some kind of online leaderboards/rankings/integration. Depends on the effort/payoff balance.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>From Here</b></span><br><br>I've got the story and mechanics for the rest of the game mostly mapped out. There's a lot of stuff I think is cool and that I'd like to show in here. But I kinda want the rest of the game to be a surprise and am thinking to avoid posting any further content here.<br><br>Not sure how I should handle this actually. Any thoughts? At the very least, I'll respond to comments here. And I'm planning to keep a private devlog of my progress. Something I can post here after the game's release.

The reducing food costs was planned, but I completely forgot about it. I'll definitely do that. Luggage is something I cut for good after implementing the search system. It just turned out to not be necessary enough to be worth the work. The other stuff is cool, but not quite what I have in mind.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@qqqbbb:</b></span>  [rightclick drag papers, slavic gender names]</span><br>Someone else suggested right-click for dragging papers back. My response was that I don't want to add a whole new drag mode to optimize out a part of the game that I think is important. For the names, I actually have some gender consideration for the names, but I guess it could be wrong. The problem unfortunately will only get worse when I integrate the user-submitted names. There's over 10,000 of them now so I'll probably just punt on any kind of gender correctness.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@arkhometha:</b></span>  [newspaper bug]</span><br>Thank you for trying to reproduce this bug. Someone contacted me with a video showing the glitch. Basically, you have to correlate his name with the card, then when the detain button pops up, click it and immediately give him the card. The detain button will pop up a second time. If you hit it then, the newspaper will show both stories.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@Gila:</b></span>  This kind of takes the challenge out of the game and reduces the replayability value at least for me</span><br>The main story mode will only have a small amount of randomness. I'm more inclined to get the narrative right than to make it replayable.

The world is overflowing with countries that use the eagle. I realize it's not normally associated with communism but it's a more eye-catching government-y symbol for me than a star or sickle. The original eagle was based on the Romanian shield. I wanted something more crazy and so switched to the current mix of screaming bird and American eagle.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Re: Ideas/Suggestions</b></span><br>Part of my goal for this game is to do a lot with very little. It's basically a single-screen game with a mostly-static interface. I've worked out enough of the story to think that I can make a good game using only the elements that are already there. That means I probably won't add new modes like night-time duty, walking-to-work, or pulling-guns-on-entrants. I know this sounds short-sighted, but please just give me the benefit of the doubt. <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> There is still a lot of unexplored territory in only the features available in the beta. There's more I haven't shown and I want to explore that thoroughly before adding anything else.

If you don't care about that, then currently there's no difference. As a practical matter, the nudity needs to be optional. I'm totally fine giving up a little bite from the game's message for practicality. You're not the first person to complain about the issuing cities. I think TB even explicitly ignored them. Again, this is one of those things (along with the too-small desk and lack of hotkeys) that I really enjoy about the game. An inspector needs to know lots of random facts. And the only cost of not knowing is time to look it up.<br><br><hr>

<br>You know I'm not sure. Humble Store gives the biggest cut but yeah, that means it won't get a feature on Steam. I think Steam at least isn't that interested in the preorder phase since there's no bonuses or discounts. I really wanted to add bonuses, but Steam isn't built for extra non-DLC content that's external to the game.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">I'd like to congratulate you on this victory.<br>Finishing a game is difficult, but you pulled it off in quite a nice fashion.

<br>Thank you (and everyone else)!<br><br>It's been so long since the last public beta, I'm beyond nervous about how the game will be received. So many little things I want to tweak and fix but at the same time I'm completely burnt out.

Since the launch I've been working 20 hour days on support responses and putting the first update together, which fixes a shit ton of stuff.<br><br>On top of that, there's been an endless stream of review code requests.

              Gonna start posting some postmortem stuff here now.<br><br><span style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>After The Beta</b></span><br>The last beta (0.5.13) was released in April (?) and had 8 days of gameplay. It feels like a solid demo but nothing beyond that had been implemented. In the time between April and July, I worked to fill out the mechanics and story.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Story</b></span><br>Of all the things that went into the game, the hardest part for me to do, by far, was arranging the overall progression and narrative. During the entire development I collected and implemented small encounters or mechanics. Coming up with these was really fun; spy document handoff, nosy reporter, time bomb defusing, corrupt guard, etc. The task of tying all that together with a logical progression and interesting story was not as fun. I wanted the gameplay to evolve at a good pace but also to motivate each new mechanic with a story element. And with lots of these things to lay out, it's also important to avoid having too many things happen at once that can misdirect or confuse the player. <br><br>As an example, there's a secret document hand-off encounter early in the game. You get handed two identical documents and need to keep them straight:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yy0N04a.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Implementing this was easy but there was no clear place to put it in the game. The event involves a bulletin callout, 2 travelers (the spy and his follower), and 2 documents. It's a pretty heavy event actually because once you read the bulletin, you're on the lookout for the first spy and his follower; it somewhat consumes the player's headspace. This meant that I didn't want it to overlap with any other days where you have an important bulletin message, when you're expecting someone specific, or when you have another document handoff. It finally wound up on the same day you meet Calensk. Now the problem is that as soon as you read the bulletin about a spy coming, this military-looking guy walks up. Naturally you'd think he was the spy. If I had any other choice I would've moved this encounter or Calensk's intro but out of the 31 days there was no other place. I ended up just letting these events overlap but made one small dialog addition to clear up any confusion. When Calensk walks in for the first time, the inspector asks "Are you the spy?", to which he responds "What? No". <b>Ship it.</b><br><br>This is one example but there were lots of cases like this where I had to be very careful with the arrangement. Each event, encounter, mechanic, introduction, etc required coordination with everything else. I started by layings things out on paper but that didn't last long. Eventually I do what I normally do and wrote a tool to help:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AmtXtjzl.png" alt="" border="0">  <br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AmtXtjz.png" target="_blank">Full-size</a><br><br>This is the basic story layout tool. Each column is a day and the boxes represent mechanics, rules, news stories, travelers, bulletins, etc. I define the dependencies in a simple text format then load it up here and slide the boxes around to visualize how everything will play out. Some events have multiple boxes spanning several rows and several days. Once everything was set up I could quickly see empty or crowded spaces and tweak things accordingly.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Economy</b></span><br>For the beta release, the game had a very simple economy. I didn't put much thought into it at the time and there were lame ways to exploit your income. For the final game I knew I'd need better planning to put the average player under constant money pressure. Again, this is something I tackled with a custom tool.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ijJD0EK.png" alt="" border="0">  <br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nbVRBuN.gif" target="_blank">Full-size animated gif</a><br><br>The days are listed from top to bottom this time. Each row represents one day and has the news stories, processing (T=traveler, P=penalty, D=detain), special encounters (bribes, story events), nighttime messages, and expenses. Each element is a button and allows quickly testing different scenarios by toggling each effect on and off. For example, clicking the [P2] on the first line will simulate getting 2 penalties on day one. That effect will propagate through the entire game to show nighttime earnings, adjusted events, and even when the family would start dying. <br><br>This economy simulator was one of my more useful tools made for the game. The stuff I learned with it fed back into the story layout to let me know when it would be good to add a bribery or other money-affecting event. The niece event was laid out this way. I saw a dip below zero on one day and came up with the story for her to appear with her mom's savings as relief.<br><br><br><hr>

              <span style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Stuff That Was Cut</b></span><br>One of the most valuable lessons I learned working in AAA is that nothing is above being cut. Developing (and finishing) a game is just as much about removing things as it is adding them. Cutting stuff out that doesn't add to the experience or when the payoff doesn't match up with the cost of implementation is actually something I enjoy. It keeps me constantly thinking about the core of what makes a game fun or interesting.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Baggage</b></span><br>From the very beginning I envisioned a simple baggage-inspecting mechanic. Basically just like the body scanner but with randomized contents and a gun or two every once in a while. I kept putting off the implementation until eventually it wasn't needed. The game was already fun without it and adding it would've been a sizable task. Instead, I made it a point that baggage is not allowed so it sorta fit well with the narrative.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Booth Shenanigans</b></span><br>The booth screen was supposed to have more going on. The shutter switch is some evidence of that; there were plans to have immigrants pull a gun or otherwise threaten the inspector. When this happened you'd have to close the shutter quickly or pull your own gun or something. Like the baggage though, I held off implementing it long enough to decide that it wasn't necessary. Normally I'd remove any vestiges of a cut feature but in this case I left the shutter switch in. It's a fun little thing to role play and it comes in handy for triggering a hint early in the game. I still get comments about the pointlessness of this switch though. Maybe I should've removed it.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>UV Seals</b></span><br>I think these are mentioned briefly in the devlog somewhere. The document seals were supposed to grow more involved. As part of the general progression of complexity, I wanted to add a special UV light in the late game that would be needed to verify a new type of document seal. The idea was to have only a small area of the desk lit by UV light. You'd have to move the document into this area to reveal a second "hidden" image in the seal that needed to match the rulebook. It seemed like a cool way to increase the difficulty and would've been a nice technical effect. Unfortunately and once again, this feature got pushed back far enough that it fell off the edge. Unlike some of the other cut stuff, I held out on this one for a bit longer though. I was ready to add it in until the last few weeks, when I'd laid out enough of the story and progression to find there was no room left for it.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Search Photo Confiscation</b></span><br>This is the latest major cut I can remember. An early assumption was that the game would have both the search mechanic (which left naked photos on your desk) and a way to sell those photos for money. There's even a devlog post where I'm wink wink hinting at this, as if it's not an obvious extension of the search mechanic. This is basic low hanging fruit when dealing with the concepts of security and privacy wrapped up in body scanning. Surely those security personnel are keeping and/or profitting from naked pictures of people. Now you can too! The mechanic worked like this:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kncyymO.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I didn't want (too many) documents crowding your desk so I created the confiscation drawer. Search photos would automatically move to your confiscation drawer and stay there until the end of the day. Unsavory characters would come in and offer you 5 credits per photo, which you could drag out of the drawer and give to them. Easy.<br><br>The confiscation drawer was a nice solution to the technical problem of having a full day's worth of unique documents loaded in memory. As soon as the person walks out of the booth, the custom photo is unloaded and the confiscation envelope changes to become a generic "closed envelope" with some descriptive text.<br><br>Everything here was completely implemented before I started laying out the final days of the game. That's when I noticed a few problems. <br><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>Why are only passports and search photos confiscatable?</li>
<li>Passport confiscation is a critical end-game revelation.</li>
<li>Search photo confiscation is a setup for a few obvious (and superfluous) encounters.</li>
<li>All the rules about confiscation have to mention both photos and passports.</li>
<li>Search photos appear very early in the game but passport confiscation only makes sense near the end.</li>
</ul>
<br>The big problem for me was a softening of the focus on passport confiscation. Taking someone's passport is a clear escalation on the things-are-getting-serious scale. This sets up the scenario of having your own family's passports taken and leads directly into the end game. Selling someone's bodyscan photo is just another notch on the creeper-security-agent-is-selling-my-naked-pics scale. Under the original scenario, the drawer appeared along with the ability to search, near the start of the game. This meant you could confiscate photos for a long time when suddenly you'd have to start taking passports too. There'd be no obvious UI hint for this change (the drawer was almost always there, just now you should put passports in too). From a mechanics and progression perspective, I found there was a lot more impact if the confiscation drawer was introduced for the purpose of taking passports. <br><br>Giving up for-sure features like this can be hard, especially after they're implemented. Whenever you have a bunch of issues pile up related to a specific feature though, it's worth taking a step back and asking yourself what you gain or lose by cutting it.<br><br>Ultimately, even though I'd already implemented photo confiscation, it was an easy choice to remove it. Taking it out gave me a better game in every way, leaving the concept of confiscation limited to passports. Probably my favorite cut.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The Overwatcher</b></span><br>If you go back through the devlog, you can find some discussion of how weird it is to get detailed citations for mistakes. As if someone is watching over your shoulder. Why not have <i>that</i> guy check the passports? This bothered me for most of the project and I considered a few different ways to handle it. My original plan was to incorporate this "overwatch" theme deeply into the core gameplay and story.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5g70G13.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>In the beta, you can see the not-yet-functional overwatch light on the stamp bar. It wasn't going to be explained until much later, but the overwatcher worked in shifts. When this light was on, he was watching; if it turned off, he wasn't. If you wanted to approve someone with a mistake on their passport, you could avoid a citation by waiting until the light went out to quickly stamp/return the documents. With the overwatcher part of the core mechanics like this, he was also going to show up in the story. Sergiu was originally supposed to have some kind of connection with the overwatcher. I hadn't worked out any details but figured there was potential for favors to be exchanged. I also wanted one of the EZIC agents work his way into the overwatch position with your help. If you approved a certain agent, a few days later you'd receive a printout letting you know that EZIC is now in control of the overwatch post and all the rules have changed. That would've created an interesting situation where the printed bulletin and rulebook meant nothing and the player had to work against a different set of secret EZIC commands.<br><br>So that was all well and good; lots of potential. I really like this kind of subversion of expectations, where the rules change suddenly or the player is faced with something unexpected and has to change their thinking. <br><br>After working through a few scenarios though, I was left overall with a worse game than before. The moment the script flips is all well and cool but it's at the cost of everything before and after. If the overwatcher works in obvious shifts then all the sob story immigrants just become a case of waiting a few seconds for the light to go out. It changes the focus from the interesting stuff to watching for a light to turn off.<br><br>After that realization, I considered ditching the light mechanic but keeping the tangible overwatcher. There'd be no way to "cheat" the citations but I could keep the EZIC overwatch-takeover concept and have all the rules change in the late game. Maybe that could've worked with a lot of careful thought but in the end I was left feeling that it weakened a central premise of the game that you're a powerless cog in an uncaring machine. If the overwatcher is a guy that can be so easily reached then maybe the system isn't so overbearing. Unaddressed and untouchable though, it becomes an implicit force outside of any influence. I feel this works better for both the gameplay and the story. In the final game there's only a touch of mystery behind the citations but it's (I hope) quickly accepted as an implicit construct.<br><br>Even beyond these two (good) reasons, messing with the citation system subverts the right-or-wrong judgement tied to the core mechanic of finding discrepancies. Once that judgement is abandoned, the discrepancy hunt falls apart completely. That was especially decisive for me since I strongly believe in the importance of gameplay systems in effective interactive media. <b>This cut goes all the way to the top.</b><br><br>Also I removed the overwatch light. People were clicking it like a button.<br><br><br><hr>

<br>Yeah this was a happy result of changing to the simple ending style. The full interactive segment would've been much closer to Arstotzkan-level bureaucracy in order to force the tension.
