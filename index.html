<br><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=29750.msg925363#msg925363" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Release info in the announcement post here &lt;&lt;</a></b></span></div>
<br><hr>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Old Stuff</b></span><br><br>Ever taken an international flight to a foreign country and felt nervous passing through the immigration checkpoint? <i>Papers, Please</i> aims to turn that around and put you in the role of immigration inspector. Instead of working in a nice modern airport booth, you're assigned to the Ministry of Admission in the war-torn dystopian nation of Arstotzka. <br><br>The glorious and free country of Arstotzka has just ended a 6-year war with neighboring Kolechia and reclaimed its rightful half of the border town, Grestin. Your job is to control the flow of people entering the Arstotzkan side of Grestin from Kolechia. Among the throngs of immigrants and visitors looking for work are hidden smugglers, spies, and terrorists. Using only the documents provided by travelers and MoA's primitive computer dispatch system you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.<br><br>Ok, that's the setup. Some elements of this are pretty similar to my other game, "The Republia Times". I'm a sucker for dystopian settings.<br><br>Let's have a mockup:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BhXlv19.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Lookin a bit empty at this point. The enemy country is on the left and your country is on the right. The top of the screen is the actual border checkpoint and the bottom is inside your booth. Travelers will queue on the top left, pass through your inspection building, then on to enter Arstotzka on the top right. People will enter the inspection booth, you click on their documents and vet them by looking for discrepancies, then you either approve their entry visa or deny their crossing (with or without prejudice).<br><br>A little closer:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6OTH0NO.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I haven't completely worked out the precise mechanics yet, but it's probably going to boil down to inspecting all the documents and trying to find any two pieces of information that don't match. For example, if a traveler's passport says they weigh 70kgs, but their current measured weight is 74kgs, you have reason to be suspicious. Highlighting these two pieces of information in the UI will open up further options. In this case, you now need to run a metal detector over the guy or even strip search him. Turns out he just gained some weight so he's clear to pass. Enjoy your time in Arstotzka.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Motivation</b></span><br>The last few games I've worked on have been programming-first, art-second. This time I'm going to try to focus on the art. I'm envisioning lots of cool little pixel portraits and documents and not so many technical challenges. A big part of the game is the traveler portraits so I want to spend a fair amount of time creating those. I'm also considering a system to create face variations from my initial drawings. I guess that would be a technical task so we'll see.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>More About the Art</b></span><br>I don't have any formal art training so I'm just gonna copy what I see elsewhere. One thing I like about some of the better pixel-art games is the limited palette. Instead of choosing a global palette though, I'm going to try limiting individual objects or backgrounds to ~3 shades. That's not a hard rule and if it doesn't look good I'm flexible. You can already see a few places in the mockup like that. <br><br>For the initial version of the game I'm going to do everything in mid-res pixel art. Pixel art is just way easier, faster, and more enjoyable for me. When it comes to most commercial games however I think pixel art may not be a good choice. It works great for indies and people close to the scene, but my feeling is that most mainstream players prefer a smoother non-pixelated look. I've made some rough experiments with converting the small character portraits to full vector images and they don't look half bad. If I decide to turn this in to a commercial game it's possible I'll do that for all the art. I kinda did the same thing with Helsing's Fire and that turned out ok.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Technical</b></span><br>I've got a really sweet custom C++ engine built on SDL just sitting here but I'm planning to use HaxeNME for this project. I've done 2 flash games before and really like the fact that they're so easy for others to play. HaxeNME looks interesting and is a slight hedge on this game getting good enough to sell as a native app. Actually I'm a full-time indie developer so I'm really hoping to sell the game when it's done. If it's any good. Next point..<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>DevLog</b></span><br>I've made a bunch of games but never kept a devlog before. I'll do my best to keep this thread updated with screenshots and builds. I don't expect the entire game to take more than a few <del>weeks</del> months to develop. <del>I'll probably edit that sentence out in a few months</del>. Any feedback is appreciated.<br><br><div align="center">______________________________________________________________________<br><br>There are updates throughout the thread, but I'll just put this here:<br><br><b><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><a href="http://dukope.com/#ppl" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Get the Latest Build &lt;&lt;</a><br></span></b><br>(Currently in beta so missing some stuff)<br><br>______________________________________________________________________<br>

              Thanks guys.<br><br>Panurge, I just played through your <a href="https://claviusboon.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">Tower of Clavius Boon</a> and loved it. Completely hilarious with great writing. Looking forward to the rest of it.

              <blockquote class="blockquote">Haha, nice concept. So the whole game will take place in one setting then?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>More or less, yeah. There will be some activity in the border checkpoint area at the top, but most of the focus will be in the booth.<br><br>If the inspection gameplay works out ok, I'm also thinking of incorporating the contrary mode where you work as a smuggler/spy-chief/terrorist-leader for the enemy state. You'd be assigned tasks ("smuggle 20kg of bullets"), recruit agents to pass through the border, set them up with fake documents, hide contraband on their body (you know where), and send them through the checkpoint. I guess that would take place in a different setting.<br><br>A possible extension of that is to have player-created smugglers in the pool of travelers passing through player-controlled inspectors. And THAT... might make a half-decent play-by-day multiplayer game.<br>

              More progress on the mockup (slightly too wide for the forum, scroll to see it all):<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y8pjneT.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>At the top you can now see the queue of people and several guards. I'm hoping to have all this animate naturally. It'll probably just look like an unholy mess of swimming pixels but I'm gonna try it anyways.<br><br>When called, one person will walk into the inspection booth and appear close-up at the bottom. Likewise anyone you approve for entry will visibly leave the booth and walk off to the right. If you reject someone's entry they may be sent home or arrested. In these cases they'll leave the booth back to the left side of the checkpoint. The passageway off the top leads to jail so the plan is to have the guards drag any smugglers/spies/terrorists up there.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Action</b></span><br>I'd like to include a small action element in the game and from this mockup you can kinda see where it would happen. The wall in the middle is quite tall, but not impossible to climb. If one of the travelers gets restless or desperate they may try to run past the guards, scale this wall, and escape into Arstotzka. If they make it over this wall, an action sequence begins where your cursor becomes a sniper crosshair. You'll have about 3 seconds to shoot them with a tranquilizer before the guards on the right open fire. So you get one last chance to save their life. Or maybe they're a suicide bomber and you're really saving the guards from instant death.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Misc</b></span><br>In the inspection screen, I've added the speaker (to ask questions and view the transcript) and the computer teletex handle (to request information from MoA computers and view results). These both show how many items are available.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Issues</b></span><br>Also in this mockup you can see the tight squeeze for the documents window. I really want to be able to inspect 2 docs at a time, but with this layout there's not enough room. Gonna have to think about how to handle that better.

Wasn't sure if you could get semi-natural idle, walk, run cycles out of a 1-color 8x18 pixel character. Not sure I succeeded but it's close enough for now. Searched around for a good sprite anim editor before settling on Pixen (OSX). To be honest I'm not that happy with it but it's better than Photoshop for animation. My biggest gripe is that there's no way to preview multiple sequences together. Which leads to...<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Programming</b></span><br>I think I'll start putting together some code to preview animation sequences. The current animation doesn't look that great yet but I can probably improve it with better tools and more time. To that end I'm gonna dive into HaxeNME and try to get a simple animation previewer up and running. Just need something to load in multiple animated gifs and string them together with individual repeat counts. Or something.<br>

<br>Hah, thanks! No rotoscoping, I just drew those frames by hand. With so few pixels it's pretty easy to iterate on. Now that you mention it though, rotoscopy is exactly the look I'm going for.  I kept thinking "natural" animation but what I want is that classic low-res rotoscoping feel.

<br>I was thinking it best to stick to 16:9, but after seeing your mockup I'm not so sure anymore. 3:2 gives a lot more room to work with. I probably don't know enough about what kinds of documents the game will include to decide right now but I'm gonna experiment with 960x640 as you suggest. Thank you for the ideas! I absolutely don't mind you editing the mockup and I really appreciate the help.<br><br>Btw, this is exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy. I'll take a limited resolution, palette, or game mechanic over unlimited freedom any day. Given Pioneers resolution and (awesome) palette, I'll bet you're the same way <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">

<br>Thanks spolvid. This game will probably have a similar flavor so I hope you enjoy it too.<br><br>Slightly updated layout with taller resolution:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aS4gS.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Eigen's suggestion prompted me to keep experimenting with the mockup. With a 3:2 aspect, there's room to rearrange the inspection booth a bit and give the doc inspection area more space. Each document can be maximum 150x215 and 2 documents can be visible at any time. Teletex query results, the audio transcript, and the rule book will behave just like documents. This'll be nice for consistency and having the docs side-by-side makes it easier to find and highlight discrepancies. 150x215 is not a lot of space but my feeling is that the docs shouldn't be too complicated so hopefully it works out.<br><br>Closeup:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vqdTc.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>From left to right there's a clock, scale readout, microphone, computer screen, and notebook. Not sure what to do with the clock just yet but there'll probably be some time component to the gameplay. Scale shows the person's weight, mic will show the audio transcript document when clicked, computer screen will show the teletex document when clicked, and the notebook will show the rule book when clicked. <br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Rule Book</b></span><br>In order to establish the baseline regulations for which documents and information a traveler must have to enter, there's a rule book. This lists things like "Traveler must have an entry permit", "Traveler must be over 18", etc. If a rule is being broken, it can be highlighted for further options. One example would be the "Traveler must be over 18" rule. If you inspect their passport and calculate their age to be &lt; 18, you can select both their passport birthdate and the age rule. This will highlight the discrepancy and open up a teletex query or a question you can ask the traveler.

</blockquote>
<br>Thanks Shine and makerimages. After reading this I figured it'd be best to prototype the gameplay ASAP. Instead of spending more time on the animations (which I'm pretty sure will work out ok), I've moved ahead to the core mechanics (some doubt here).<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>First Build!</b></span><br>In the last couple days I've gotten up and running with HaxeNME. You can "play" the first build here:<br><a href="http://pope.jeffsys.net/play.php?g=ppl" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TToyx.png" alt="" border="0"></a><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Drag And Then Drop</b></span><br>I originally intended to have the documents just be clickable on the left; after which they show up in one of 2 fixed-width columns on the right. Nice and simple. Unfortunately that felt a bit lifeless when I prototyped it. There was also the general problem of space; each document would be limited to 150 pixels wide. <br><br>Instead there's now full drag-n-drop across the counter and desk. I think this solves the space problem nicely as you can always shuffle things around to see large documents. It also feels a lot cooler IMO. Much more like actually inspecting a pile of papers and a little bit fun in it's own right.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Haxe/NME</b></span><br>I gotta say, HaxeNME is pretty nice. There are a few quirks but for a non-taxing 2D game it's great so far. With MonoDevelop (on OSX) and the HaxeNME extension there's tab-completion, nice error messages, and one-click building for flash/mac/windows/etc. Some stuff doesn't work quite the same on all platforms but it's as close to write-once/run-everywhere as I've seen.<br><br>Curiously, one of the trickier things to get right was the double-size pixel rendering. Flixel makes this easy as it blits everything to it's own sprite, then scales that up. You can do something similar in vanilla HaxeNME but it's not really optimal for the native targets. I ended up scaling the root DisplayObject, snapping pixel locations while dragging, and writing custom functions to generate nearest-neighbor rotated bitmaps at half-res. Also, I'm using a bitmap font class (<a href="https://github.com/Beeblerox/BitmapFont" target="_blank">pxBitmapFont</a>) since rendering .ttfs seems to always have some level of anti-aliasing.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Procedural Generation</b></span><br>I really like procedural generation for puzzle/logic games like this. For one, it keeps the game interesting for me personally during development. For another, it makes generating lots of content much easier. In this case, the travelers will be generated randomly from a set of rules. My next steps will probably be fleshing out the game world and working out what these rules are.

              Thanks for the feedback everyone!<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">* What if I allow everyone into the country? Are there any penalties for doing that? If so, what are they.<br>* What happens if I don't allow anyone into the country? I mean a total blockade.<br>* As the player, what is the end goal? I mean, at what point is the game considered completed.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I think the gameplay will probably be divided into days with daily quotas. I'd say your goal is to process people as quickly as possible and not make any mistakes. There'll be a proper narrative and story arc to tie the days together. The low level day-to-day stuff is random within parameters; the story is scripted.<br><br>If you don't let anyone through, you'd probably get fired after a few days. If you let everyone through, you'll be responsible for spy/terrorist/smuggler activity. I'm thinking to show performance reports at the end of each day to let you know how you're doing. Some results will be more immediate. For example, a terrorist suicide bomber may detonate onscreen immediately after he passes through your booth. Bad lookin out.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">It would also be interesting if the player has to decide whether the picture on the passport is of the same person as the one standing in line. <br>For even more complexity make the passport picture always appear younger and with a different haircut.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Actually this is exactly what I'm planning. Even with the mockup I found it fun to dart my eyes back and forth at the passport photo and the dude's face. Same person? Possibly... A proper immigration inspector maintains a suspecting, skeptical eye. Changing up the photos with different glasses/hats/clothes/age should keep it interesting. Which leads nicely to...<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Wanted Criminals</b></span><br>The computer terminal, when inspected, will display multiple screens that you can flip between. One of these screens will contain a photo list of known spies/terrorists/criminals/smugglers. As you vet each person, don't forget to compare their face against the current bulletin photos. If you find a match, highlight their face and the photo to reveal an "arrest this punk" option.<br><br>Some kind of "urgent bulletin" system built on this could create pretty cool Bourne moments too. You may get an urgent bulletin and expect the criminal to show up (in disguise) within the next few minutes or not at all.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Forged Documents</b></span><br>Along with a list of basic regulations, the rule book will also contain samples of many common documents and passport covers from all surrounding countries. It'll be up to you to cross reference these samples to make sure the traveler's documents aren't forgeries. What I like about this is that after a few days, you'll have memorized how the most common docs should look and won't need to waste precious time referencing the rule book.

</blockquote>
<br>Well damn. That's one of the things I was quite happy with. You don't have to drop the document first before seeing it on the desk.

              <span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Faces</b></span><br>Drew some more traveler faces:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FxG8y.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Even though the colors aren't great and the detail level is inconsistent, this is the general style I'm targeting.<br><br>Since I won't be able to draw hundreds of unique faces for an endless supply of travelers I'll need some kind of procedural system to generate variations. Originally I thought I could map the face onto a rough triangle mesh and just push a few of the points around. After looking at the drawings though I don't think that'll look any good or give enough variety.<br><br>Instead, I experimented in photoshop and came up with a much simpler technique that divides each face into 3 parts:<br>1. head &amp; shoulders<br>2. both eyes<br>3. mouth &amp; nose<br>#1 defines roughly where the mouth, nose, and eyes should appear so it's possible to take a random #2 and #3 and place/scale them into the generally correct place. <br><br>To get something like this:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hw0aQ.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Hmm... Bro seems fine but sis looks a little off. And using the entire head&amp;shoulders means the silhouette doesn't have any variety. Maybe splitting the shoulders out or adding some headgear overlays would help. But they do look human; and pretty different from the source.<br><br>This technique makes generating "slightly wrong" variations for forged documents really easy. And if I'm able to draw young versions of all the original faces, those pieces could be slotted in the same way for older documents. Could also add metadata to the faces ("HasGlasses", "WearingHat", etc) that would make adding accessories possible.

Then the game loads those up, cuts out bits from different faces and pastes them together.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OzlwG.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Pretty happy with this given how simple it is. If I draw just 8 sheets there'll be 32,768 unique faces.<br><br>The one thing I'm gonna do from here is try marking the head and shoulders separately so those can also be varied.

<br>I wanted the dates to feel as if they're from an alternate timeline (just 2-digits), and foreign (YY.MM.DD). I'm American and prefer MM.DD.YYYY but I live in Japan where we use YY.MM.DD with a 2-digit emperor year. From the choices I figured YY.MM.DD would have the least chance of being confused for either DD.MM.YY or MM.DD.YY and so would work equally well for EU and US people. Got that one wrong. Mostly because:<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Also, that ISO 8601 link also mentions that the year for a year/month/day format is 4 digits, not 2.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">...Of course having the year as 2 digits instead of 4 makes it ambiguous again in some cases.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>You're both right and I'd guess this is the main problem. In the current build I intentionally chose a date (62.11.23) that could only be interpreted in one way, but dates are an important element of the gameplay and I don't think it's worth the confusion. I'm gonna try to fit the full 4-digit year in there and possibly choose the format based on locale so you'd get either DD.MM.YYYY, MM.DD.YYYY, or YYYY.MM.DD depending on your location.<br>

Since the rulebook contains example photos of how certain documents should look, the player would have to visually compare them to detect forgeries. I couldn't really figure out what kinds of layout changes made sense though. If someone goes through the trouble to forge a document, they're gonna get the basic layout right.

Accepted seals are listed in the rulebook:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mrl2m.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>And must appear on official documents:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CX7dm.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>There's some nice potential for an arms race here. As the game progresses, more and more complicated seals will be introduced as the criminals catch up. Gotta stay one step ahead. The potential is also there for special infrared seals that must be viewed under a special light in order to verify them.

<br>Nothing except the inefficiency of it. On those traveling light (traveler with passport, entry permit, responses, appearance, and your rulebook) there are about 35 unique pieces of information.

And just like real life, you'll have to decide if it's worth flipping through the rulebook looking for a specific rule, or sending a slow telex query to check a name.

<br>Thank you and yes :D One of my motivations for making this game is to exploit the player's morals and give them tough choices. I think there's more potential for hard choices here than in Republia Times. Actually the examples you mention are spot on.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>A Few Faces</b></span><br>One of the nice things about doing both programming and art is that I can take a break from one and focus on the other. Perfect for when I get burnt out on something. I spent a few hours yesterday just drawing faces. Two new sheets:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpro349xhXo" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZeyGD.png" alt="" border="0"></a><br>Click the picture to see a time-lapse of the drawing. Not that exciting really.<br><br>You can see I'm running out of ideas for the clothes and they're getting a little crazy.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Lemme Just Stamp This</b></span><br>So you've checked someone's documents and it's all in order. How do you approve their entry and send them through? In the real world the inspector puts a sticker on your passport and stamps it with some time information. My original plan was to put some stamps on the counter (red = deny, green = approve):<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S9ENA.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>To stamp a document, drag it from the counter and over to the desk. Same drag/drop interface as the papers:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6UQJh.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It's easy to position, but how do you actually stamp it? With drag/drop, you grab the object on mouse-down and drop it on mouse-up. If you don't drag, it's easy to detect a mouse-up with no movement and apply a click. So that'd work here too. Drag the stamp into place, drop it, then click it to apply. Unfortunately this feels lame. Applying the stamp on mouse release just doesn't have the satisfaction. What you want is a nice solid THUNK when pressing the mouse down, not when you let go.<br><br>So I switched gears and am now experimenting with a stamp "bar" that pulls out over the desk. In this case, the stamps are immovable and you have to arrange the documents beneath them before stamping. Feels much better:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i3JbQ.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Once you stamp the passport and hand all the documentation back they'll grab everything and walk out to the right.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Haxe/NME</b></span><br>I've spent enough time with Haxe now to have both good and bad impressions. <br><br><b>Bad</b><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>
<b>A 'meta-language' with no home</b><br>Haxe is translated into other languages (flash, js, c++, etc) and has no compiler. It supports a lot of target languages and although it doesn't take a lowest-common-denominator approach, it does sacrifice some features. The big one for me is proper class member scoping. There's no concept of true "private" members like you'd see in C# or C++. This makes it hard to build robust inheritance classes without stepping all over your base class's members. I generally keep my class hierarchies as shallow as possible so this is less of a problem but it has come up a few times. The usual way around it is to use adapter or helper classes instead of inheritance.<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>NME has some missing features</b><br>Although the NME build process is fantastic, the C++/js/flash APIs all have little differences that need to be worked around. So far the biggest missing pieces are in the BitmapData class. For now I can handle the necessary tweaks.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Good</b><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>
<b>Modern syntax and features</b><br>Coming from C, C++ (and even C#), Haxe is refreshingly modern. The type system is good and the reflection API is simple to use and powerful.</li>
<li>
<b>First-class functions</b><br>Having first-class functions that can be passed around as variables is great and can simplify a lot of normally difficult tasks. Love it. As an example, using reflection and first-class functions I was able to create a simple state machine class that handles all the animation and state changes for game objects. Not possible in C++ without pains.<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Succinct</b><br>I think a good way to gauge the value of a language is to look at how much code is required to perform common tasks. The less code required, the better the language. Haxe scores well here.<br>
</li>

<br>Just some artificial gating since there's no other reason to highlight yet. In the end, the denied stamp will always be available and highlighting errors will allow further actions like in one of the animated gifs I posted.<br><br>I agree it definitely needs some audio.

<br>Yeah there's only illegitimate travelers at the moment. This build is to nail down the procedural mechanics of inspecting documents.

For instance, if they don't have an entry permit and you ask them about it, they could say something like "Whoops, here it is." and put it on the counter.<br><br>For this dialog system I'm going to try to categorize responses into different "personalities" which would enable applicants to be dickheads, sympathetic, indifferent etc.<br><br><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;">Tracking Performance</span></b><br>One issue I haven't gotten to yet is how to show player performance. If the game is broken into days, there should be some stat thing that shows at the end of each day. I was recently thinking it might be cool to have this be a sort of flash-forward "Where are they now" summary for each traveler you dealt with.<br><br>As an example, if you let a smuggler through in error, it would give a small report like "[PICTURE] Anton Sarvoy: Arrested for smuggling. Detained and executed". Or hopefully it's something more positive. If you had mercy on someone with poor documentation: "[PICTURE] Alice Mitchells: Reunited with son. Gainfully employed." So these blurbs are from the far future, not just the next day. Might be kinda weird in that sense.<br><br><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;">On the other hand</span></b><br>I think some of an immigration inspector's anxiety comes from not knowing what happens to the immigrants they process every day. In <i>Papers Please</i> there will be immediately visible consequences in some cases (terrorist bomber). But in other cases the person will just pass through and you won't know what happened until the stats screen at the end of each day. Not sure if I want to try to capture that sense of not-knowing and show only minimal stats or treat it more like a game with detailed information on each immigrant.<br>

Maybe your "score" will actually be your money. Some less-than-honest applicants can offer you money up front, or the promise to mail cash to you later in exchange for a quick approval. This'll give you some non-altrusitic incentive to let the bad ones through.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Progression</b></span><br>The money system could also nicely tie in to the overall progression. Let's say you receive a daily salary from the Ministry based on performance. Each day you lose a little money due to living expenses. Your current income represents your wealth bracket, of which there are several. The story and game progresses as you move up the brackets.

</blockquote>
<br>No correlation between which things? For a missing entry permit (for non-Arstotzkans only), you have to highlight the rule and the counter top. I'll fix the other stuff you mentioned. In the next build you'll be able to click the "Passport ISS field must be valid" to correlate with a wrong city.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">I believe that further in the development you should add document forgery errors (different typefaces, wrong paper etc.)<br>

<br>I experimented with this but decided these sorts of changes are too subtle.

<br>I can do the right-click shortcut for native builds, but not flash. Maybe I'll have the space key toggle inspection mode to make it a little faster.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Some thoughts on the rule book. The corner to flip pages could be bigger, as big as possible in my opinion. There is a ribbon on the top left, this seems to be a browser-like "go back" function.

</blockquote>
<br>You shouldn't have to flip pages too much but I agree the corner could be bigger. I made the bookmark more like a browser thinking it would be more convenient but I think you're right. I usually just end up clicking it a bunch to get back to the TOC anyways. I'll change it to just go to page one.

<br>From the many times I've gone through immigration in the past few years.

<br>Arstotzkan citizens don't need an entry permit so maybe that's what was happening? Actually it just sounds like a crazy bug.

<br>Good idea. It's a lot easier to go to the correct nation and highlight the correct issuing cities + wrong passport but I agree that all logical methods of marking a discrepancy should work.

<br>I appreciate the detailed suggestion but there's a couple reasons why I don't think this is best.<br><br>I hate work as much as the next guy but in this case I'm not just being lazy <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/grin.gif" alt="Grin" border="0">. I intentionally designed this part of the game to be stark and simple. Basically, I want to add another facet to the primary (daytime) gameplay without too much distraction for the player.<br><br>My plan is to expand on a similar technique I used in Republia Times. In that case there was only a single sentence about the family each day but it served to humanize the player and make their daily decisions more difficult. I want to take that same effect and give it more weight. Not by defining the family more, but by providing more fine-grained influence over their wellbeing.<br><br>Although a single night screen from one day looks pretty stark, your family's status will change and progress throughout the game. If your uncle is sick too long without medicine he'll die. Or his medicine costs will go up each day. Or maybe your son's birthday is coming up and he wants a new toy. Skip your uncle's medicine for a day and you can afford the toy. Or, as you mention, a new apartment with lower rent/heating costs is available for a fee. The choices you make on this screen will have lasting effects and you'll need to be careful about how you spend your money.<br><br>About the hints from family members, there will be plenty of story and flavor elements coming from the immigrants themselves. I prefer to keep that stuff wed closely to the daily gameplay as opposed to putting it in the separate night screens.<br><br>Having said all that business, I'm not completely against more involved nightly updates. At this point I'm moving forward with this simple implementation. Later down the line it may become clear that something more complicated would benefit the game.

              Random stuff that's changed/updated recently:<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Speech Chat</b></span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9pUI9k6.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>I initially had solitary speech bubbles (visible upthread) that pop up for the dialog. The little back-and-forth at the beginning ended up being too slow and stunted with those bubbles so I changed it to more of a scrolling chat window. Flows much better although I'm not crazy about overlapping the face.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Goodbye Telex</b></span><br>In that pic you can also see that the Telex is gone from the console. I couldn't find a good use for it after adding the fingerprint system. In its place is the daily bulletin which you can reference at any time.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Daily Bulletin</b></span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4EAyiXR.png" alt="" border="0"><br>First bulletin in the game. These are waiting on your desk at the start of each day. Later bulletins will contain mugshots of wanted people. The Telex was going to have those but I think it fits better here.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Dialog</b></span><br>I've been writing a bunch of the generic question and response dialog recently. Initially I authored it to flow naturally with proper English grammar but the game lost much of its Eastern-European feel. Now I'm trying rougher, less fluent English and it's a little better:<br><br><span style="color: purple;"><i>"I'll stay for three months."</i></span> becomes <span style="color: purple;"><i>"I stay three months."</i></span><br><br>Pretty subtle but I was surprised at how the fluent English destroyed some of the mood. I hope this works better.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Action Buttons</b></span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eBAtr5v.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>These buttons will appear as the result of an interrogation. After highlighting an error in inspection mode only one option is available: Interrogate. Based on the entrant's response, one or more of these action buttons will appear. They'll stay in place until you click them or move on to the next entrant.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Giving Back</b></span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/P1IosNZ.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>Instead of just returning all the docs to the counter you now have to explicitly give them back. This'll allow confiscations and document trades later down the line.

</blockquote>
<br>There's a minimum number of people you have to process for each day. If the clock ends before this, you still need to finish out the remaining entrants (sans pay). I set it up like this so that story-critical entrants can be scripted per day and will match up with the daily bulletins. I'll try to explain this quota system in an early bulletin.

<br>Yeah. And even the predefined people often have only certain things defined. So likely their faces, nationality, and possibly errors will be different each time you play. I don't think that's too interesting though and I don't really consider a feature. Just that specifying those things hasn't been necessary yet and the random generator takes care of it without any effort.

<br>I was wondering if the warning should mention the exact mistake.

<br>Can you give me more info about this? The inspect mode should let you highlight any two pieces of information. Did you highlight two clearly discrepant pieces of info and it didn't show the Interrogate button?

<br>Ok. Thanks for trying it out again. Next build will list the mistake on the warning.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">There's a slight issue with the music.

<br>If I bump up to 16:9, there'll be a lot more room for documents. Still pondering.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">It can get a little repetive after playing for a while but I guess once the "day over" screen is fully implemented and you have to manage your earnings it would break the monotony a bit.<br>

<br>The current build is still a little barren.

Beyond that, I don't touch it, since I'm already inspecting everything.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I can see where you're coming from but the inspect mechanic is pretty set. The game needs this separate mode for the player to express their intent clearly. The fact that all errors are due to correlation (2 pieces of the same info don't match) gives a clear structure that I think is important. If you can just click on what you think is an error, there's nothing stopping you from just clicking on each piece of info in turn and waiting for the dialog to pop up. With the inspection you have to show you understand each error.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">For this situation, you'd pull the audio transcript, which is sorta hidden behind the microphone, then highlight the line where he says he came for work and the line on the entry  permit that says it is for travel, which will reveal the discrepancy.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Yeah this is the way I intended it to work. But actually DustyDrake's method should've also worked. One of my goals is to have all the logical correlations work for any given error. So if they say they're coming for work, you should be able to point out a missing work pass and get them to correct their response. I'll try to get this implemented for the next build.<br><br>I'm glad to be posting these alphas as public b/c I can easily miss "logical" correlations like this.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Later on it may not be a bad idea to have a brief tutorial of the items that are available at the start of the game. (I missed the audio transcript the first time around)<br>"Rule book to right.  Regular updated.  Check each day.  Audio transcript is middle.  Keep track, many lies traitors tell to bring down Arstotzka.  Clock to left.  Time always short.  Coffee break lever at top.  No coffee breaks, do not use."<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Good idea and brilliant text. Especially the coffee break lever is perfect. Wish I thought of it! Do you mind if I use it? Maybe I'll even issue a warning if you flip the lever.

The C++ engine is a collection of stuff I've built on and developed over the last 10 years or so. It sits atop SDL for multi-plat support and has the usual OpenGL engine features like scenes, audio, ui, etc. I like it a lot, but I think my days of maintaing custom engines are over so I chose Haxe/NME for this project.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@ sk2k</b></span><br>Old computers are the best computers.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@ Eigen</b></span><br>Thanks for having your girl check it out. A perspective like that is really helpful. The difficulty will scale up beyond the first few days but I'm definitely worried about getting that scaling right. One person's interminably slow is another's blinding fast. Maybe a difficulty setting is best. The game currently has the partial name errors she suggested, but not partial id number errors. I'll change it so only single digits can be off later on. Ditto with the seals. There's a library of slightly-off seals that come up randomly. When the game gets longer there'll be more chances to see these. About the passport expiration. Not sure what to do about that. I'll either not bring it up, or programmatically ensure that all passport expirations extend beyond the stay.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@ Baobab</b></span><br>Hehe. I think manually dragging the stamp down at the right speed would be cool at first and annoying later. I'm currently adding sound effects to the game, including a satisfying "THUNK" for the stamp, so hopefully you'll like the feel better.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@ wmcduff</b></span><br>My big fear is that ramping up too slowly results in players losing interest. <i>Helsing's Fire</i> had this problem and I still kinda regret the shallow difficulty curve there. For this game, I'm now hoping that by pointing out the specific errors on the warning slips, players can get up to speed faster.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@ corpocracy</b></span><br>Wow thank you for the long comments. About dialog trees, I'm sorry to say that I probably won't go there. From a development perspective, I don't like to write much dialog. And from a gamer perspective, I don't like to read much dialog. I think the game works better by making the motions more mechanical and less like a traditional dialog tree. At least it enhances the bureaucratic feel for me. I do like the idea about requesting a bribe though. I could fit that in with a drop-down button like the fingerprinting. The idea about the newspapers is also a good one. I've kinda rolled that idea around in my head for awhile. The newspaper headlines format is a great way to update the player without much reading. And finally, you're right about the passports. I'll definitely make them more varied since one of the main things people miss is the entrant's nationality. Not sure about color-coding their clothes but that's not outside consideration. <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><br>Thanks everybody for the comments and suggestions.

<br>Sniping is the payoff for having a top "overview" screen so I definitely don't want just an alarm button. If I had to explain the mechanics of it I'd say you're firing from a port on the right side of the booth. Maybe I could show the gun barrel peaking out or something. Or even have the bullet come from the booth so you'd be aiming a dotted trajectory line instead of a crosshair. That might help with the difficulty since currently the crosshair is too easy.<br><br>I've planned 3 options to deal with breakthroughs: <br>1. Do nothing. Guards will deal with it.

Full bonus pay.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">So...confiscation, this...new build? :D<br>

<br>Confiscation and sniping are technically implemented but not integrated into the gameplay yet.

So no new builds for a bit, sorry.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Is your job over for the day if that happens? Do you get bonus money for preventing infiltration by a foreign criminal?<br>

<br>Thanks for the info. Someone else mentioned this bug. Does she have her monitor oriented vertically by any chance? I mistakenly left some iPad orientation logic in the desktop version.

The basic pipeline is to create/edit/animate the sprite frames and save/export them as individual numbered pngs. Then comes <a href="http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker" target="_blank">TexturePacker</a> to put all the frames in one sprite sheet which the game uses. I tried lots of different sprite animation programs. Everything was recommended by somebody but since I'm on a mac, I couldn't try Graphics Gale, which many say is the best. <br><br><b><a href="http://pixenapp.com" target="_blank">Pixen</a></b><br>Pixen is a native Mac app with all the bullet-pointed features. I animated the basic traveler idle, walk, and run anims in Pixen a few months ago. When I went back a few days ago to do the rest of the animations I quickly got frustrated. Biggest problem is the export process which requires too many clicks to save out the individual pngs. Although I remember Pixen having onion skinning, I couldn't find the toggle again and gave up before spending much effort on it.<br><br><b><a href="http://www.aseprite.org" target="_blank">ASEPRITE</a></b><br>This app is clunky as hell, especially on OSX. But after learning some shortcuts it got much easier and I made good progress in spite of the completely wonky mouse movement. The load/save process is really smooth and I created the traveler climb and guard walk+idle animations fairly quickly. The onion skinning is nice. Unfortunately, I started running into problems with the explosion. My initial test came out terrible; mostly due to the limited tools available.<br><br><b>Photoshop</b><br>Realizing I'd need something cushier for the explosion pixeling, I moved over to Photoshop. Best to make the drawing easier and deal with whatever painful export process there was afterwards. Photoshop's animation system is pretty nice and I felt completely at home with the tools and layers here. PS Extended has onion skinning but I ended up doing ok without it. For exporting, there's a built-in "Export Layers" script but it's absolute shit.  Instead, I ended up saving for web to an animated gif, then extracting the frames using ImageMagick.<br><br><b><a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a></b><br>ImageMagick is a set of command-line tools for editing images. The main tool is called "convert" and lets you do all kinds of cool stuff. I've been using ImageMagick more and more recently and it's really come in handy on this project. For example, to take an animated gif, replace the background color with transparency, and export the frames as 32-bit png:<br><div class="codeheader">Code:</div>
<div class="code">convert -coalesce 'Boom.gif' -define png:format=png32 -channel rgba -fill none -draw "color 0,0 replace" border/Boom-%02d.png</div>Easy and fast.<br><br>Now that I've got the Photoshop workflow down, I'll probably stick with that for everything. In total, I spent around 6 hours yesterday on the explosion. I don't ever want to hand-pixel an explosion again. In-game, it's gone before you even notice it so I'm leaving it here for rubberneckage:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UqaZ6tE.gif" alt="" border="0">

<br>I draw the faces as whole, but their individual parts get split up and recombined by the game to make new faces.

<br>I read this a couple times but I'm sorry to say I can't understand what you're suggesting. It's possible to build more moral choices into this but honestly the whole thing takes like 5 seconds.

<br>Ok, this part I get and that's a good point that I'm thinking about now. Making it a tranquilizer instead of a bullet takes care of the darkness so I may do that. But having such an action sequence is important for variety. My only concern isn't just to pack as many moral conundrums as possible into one game. I also want it to be fun to play.

<br>This is the spreadsheet for all the per-day settings, traveler placement, news, rules, etc. Often you'll see spreadsheets like this with design logic and in this case I'm able to use the exported CSV data directly in the game. Working in a spreadsheet makes it much easier to follow and edit the progression. If this were XML I'd be constantly scrolling up and down to edit different sections. This kind of thing would probably be even easier with a custom tool but I decided that wasn't a good use of time for this project.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Travelers</b></span><br><div align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jq1u87z.png" alt="" border="0"></div>
<br>Travelers are specified in a simple tab indention format, which is parsed into a node tree by the game. Syntax highlighting is my fav so I've also made a .language file for Sublime Text 2 to color each indented line. Using this simple format I can script each traveler with as much or as little specification as necessary. So in one case I may just give one guy a little bit of custom dialog when he's rejected; Everything else would be filled in randomly by the game. In another case I can force every detail (face, name, dialog, nationality, errors, etc) to build story threads.

<br>That's basically exactly right. At the moment I'm planning on ~30 days in the final story mode.

Under certain conditions you can still lose but on the whole this mode will be deterministic.<br><br>The endless mode is something I'm considering. It depends on how much work it is to set up.

<br>Great idea about the tabs. It's too late for the beta build, but I can get that in the final. For now the game will always tell you exactly what you missed. Runners will only attempt to scale the wall if there are no guards on the left side. And I still feel the sniping is better as 1st person.

<br>Ok, trying something <del>stupid</del> bold here. I'd like to collect real* names for the immigrants. I quickly threw together some PHP so if you have a chance, want to see your name in the game, and don't mind using a working email, please try it out and let me know if you run into any problems.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>* The game has a particular eastern-bloc setting so some names work better than others. Best thing is to easternblockenize it when submitting. That'll save me the trouble of having to do the same.<br>

<br>Stamping everything was fun, but I felt just too much busywork (fine line, I know). I could make it optional (only required on the passport), but then it's confusing and you'd end up stamping everything anyways. It's hard to communicate that "you can do this optional thing here, but you don't need to; whereas over here you need to do it."<br><br>In the end you'll be stamping so many passports, trust me that you'll be glad you don't need to stamp everything.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Actually, that might be required. I tried the game last week after watching a video on it, and this happened:<br>No passport to stamp, so the game was over. If it is intended the passport might not be there, we need some way of denying them.<br>

<br>If you correlate the missing document (highlight the "need passport" rule and the counter-top), you should get a visa slip:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZWPVR9Y.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>..That'll let you deny them and move on.

<br>Yeah you gotta be careful with the stamping. A denial stamp can't be undone but an approval stamp can be overwritten with a denial stamp. Don't stamp until you're sure. I kind've expected the stamp switch to trip some people up.<br><br>I probably won't have an external readme except for credits or whatnot.

</blockquote>
<br>Thanks! I'll check the timing. I think you're supposed to always see the crowd dispersing but maybe if the timing is just right the day will end before that. I had a feeling it was too lenient with the citations. This has an effect on the night-time budget stuff, which I haven't balanced yet, so I figured it was better to be too forgiving for this build. I'll probably end up reducing the number of non-penalty warnings or jacking up the penalty as the game progresses.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">I forgot about a third thing. On OS X, the alpha version used the full screen. The current beta is centered with a huge black area filling the rest of the screen. I liked the older way better.<br>

<br>What resolution is your monitor? The game is 90 pixels wider now so it's possible you got boned on the whole-pixel scaling. There's unfortunately not much I can do about it except go back to 3:2, which I think is much worse for gameplay with less space for document shuffling.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">I encountered three very, very minor problems in Beta 0.5.5:<br>

<br>Great list, thanks for this! I'll fix each of those before final.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">In relation to posts by other people, it seems like a difficulty setting might be in order. Daily violations stack, less forgiveness, etc. Maybe you match the name of the person on our current last day to them for a tiny, tiny dialog? Then you could add some distrust systems for later days where dialog is directly monitored instead of only in relation to documentation being misread.<br>

<br>I'll give some more thought to a difficulty level. It does kinda seem like it's necessary. I don't follow the dialog suggestion though.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">

<br>Yeah every time a new mechanic is introduced, the errors will tend to use it much more.

              <span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Upscaling</b></span><br><br>For a while now, I've been thinking about how to take this pixel-graphic game and upscale it to a modern or even retina res. Although I personally like old-school pixel graphics, I don't think the appeal holds for the general population. Recently I started playing around with some options.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Hello Neighbor</b></span><br><br>I started with the game's native res of 570x320, then scaled it up x2 using nearest neighbor scaling:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wH7K4sc.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Looks good. As designed. Pixelly.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Vectorize</b></span><br><br>My original plan was to manually (using Illustrator's LiveTrace) vectorize all the game's graphics, save them as SVG, then rasterize them to the appropriate resolution on load. The faces in Helsing's Fire got this treatment and it looked great. For Papers Please, This is a much bigger task than it sounds like initially, mainly due to the upgrade from pixel fonts to proper TTFs. That requires all new font selections and basically blows the page layouts I've done so far. Working from the screenshot, I vectorized everything to get this:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/admLix1.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Hmm.. Not as f*ckin rad as I expected. The docs are much harder to read now and it feels like an inconsistent level of detail. Some of that could probably be fixed with fatter typefaces but I was tired of looking at fonts at this point. I also really miss that "ARSTOTZKA" font on the entry permit. Couldn't find anything like it in TTF.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>There's Special Stuff For That</b></span><br><br>Ok, next try: Fancy pixel rescaling. In these modern times, there are a whole bucketload of fancy pixel rescaling techniques used in the emulator scene: EPX, SuperEagle, Super2xSa, etc. I researched a few of these before stumbling on the daddy of them all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hqx" target="_blank">hqx</a>. Searching for resources on that led me to an <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kopf/pixelart/" target="_blank">impressive pixel-to-vector algorithm</a> that regrettably doesn't come with source code. It's not a total loss though, as they've set up a great <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kopf/pixelart/supplementary/multi_comparison.html" target="_blank">comparison page</a> where you can compare the results of many different algorithms easily. Here you can see hqx does really quite well.<br><br>Based on that promise, I grabbed the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/hqx/" target="_blank">hqx source</a> and compiled it for OSX with some help from <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/forum/topic/14225" target="_blank">this post</a> on the cocos2d forums. Some scaling techniques can handle dithered areas well, but hqx apparently isn't one of them. So as a first step, I converted all the dithered areas in the original image to solid blocks, then ran hqx:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YkHVsyU.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Not bad. This has a much more consistent level of detail. The text gets a _little_ weird, but I could fix that manually. It even maintains the pixel style without actually being pixelly, which I like. <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Whither Dither</b></span><br><br>Going back to compare hqx to nearest-neighbor, however, I'm still sorta drawn to the rough original. Especially when looking at the non-dithered version:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hkq0GzA.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Still chunky, but doesn't have the obvious low-res dithering.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>No Conclusion</b></span><br><br>And that's where I am right now. Haven't been able to decide for sure but I'm leaning towards hqx, with hand-tweaking and assets pre-baked at 2x, 3x, and 4x.

<br>I like that encounter because even though he (or she) is a dick, the docs are in order so you have to approve entry. I imagine there's a fair bit of those teeth-gritting moments for real immigration inspectors. I stamp the passport all crooked in those cases.<br><br><hr>

Going back to the alpha, I find it really frustrating to not know exactly what I missed when getting cited. The immediate feedback also allows me to skip a lot of introductory tutorial text and let the player learn from their mistakes as they go. Story-wise the citations are a little thorny but I have plans to address that as well.<br><br><b>I couldn't work out if there was a time limit to each day.</b><br><br>There's both a time limit and a quota.

              Back from GDC! Another great show this year. The big surprise for me was seeing my game, The Republia Times, mentioned in the <i>DIY Game Revolution</i> talk by Porpentine and Terry Cavanagh. I should probably quit now while I'm ahead.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">I have to say, given the time period you're hearkening back to, the pixelly version seems to evoke that feeling the best, even if it's actually better than what was possible at the time from what I remember/can research.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Thought you had my back, arne!<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">**Spoilerish**<br>Anyways, I just had a few clarification I wanted to make. When I played it seems like I completed a few "missions" and I got two token things. At first, I thought this was money and was thrilled. But when I got the EOD screen, I didn't know what to do with my new shiny things. I'm assuming the tokens are just a means to mark advancements, but I think this could be made more clear in the End of Day screen.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I haven't fully worked out what to do with the tokens. I like that they're unmentioned and mostly hidden. They'll probably just stay as meaningless achievements but I'll try to add some explanation.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Yeah keep the pixels, I do like the higher res font but, the pixels are better.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Games that mix pixel resolutions make my eyes twitch. So, unfortunately, going with pixels means accepting the blocky font.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Pixels vs Vectors</b></span><br><br>When I say stupid stuff like "the general population prefers vectors", I'm really just talking about myself. To me, the look of the game is not dependent on the pixels, but on the clean shapes and colors. Cleaner = better IMO. Pixels are great but they introduce an unintended roughness. My ideal game is nothing but razor-sharp visuals.<br><br>BUT, after a week at GDC, considering everyone's input, and some more thought, I've decided to just stick with pixels for Papers Please. I guess the look has grown on me and I'm also not enamored with the vector alternatives. After all the game content is done I may re-evaluate the visuals but for now I'm happy with chunky pixels and low-res fonts.<br><br>Thanks to everybody (except traitor arne) for chiming in!

This is in preparation for setting up a Steam Greenlight page. There's still a month or so of work left on the game but I figure I should take the time now to get my ducks in a row. I'm not too optimistic about Greenlight so the sooner it's set up, the longer I have to collect votes.<br><br>I hate doing trailers until the moment it's done, then I'm glad I did it. For the past few projects I used iMovie but this time I'm upgrading to FCPX. So far so good. I really prefer this clip-style editing over other NLEs like Premiere.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VtPzrNd.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>My main problem with trailers is that I am a complete slave to synced music &amp; visuals. I almost always end up writing tons of custom code to export synced frames from the game. I tell myself: "This'll be useful later, I can swap out the characters and re-export easily". It's always BS but I can't help it. Papers Please is even a little tougher because the theme music changes tempo as it progresses. This gives the track a nice racing effect but man is it a bitch to sync video with.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ISb3EEF.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Anyways, I'll probably end up spending a week on this trailer. From there I'll do the rest of the Greenlight rigamarole, then get back to development and finish up the game.<br><br>

<br>Yeah I've heard this too. But who knows what they're planning or when. For all I know it could be worse than GL. Right now the goal is to get at least one game on Steam. After that there'll be a Valve account manager contact and GL won't be necessary for future titles.<br><br>Interestingly, a game I made with my wife, Mightier, was in the very first batch of indie games added to Steam ~4 years ago. But that was freeware and whoever handled it at Valve is long gone.

              <blockquote class="blockquote">Although, I found the citation penalties were too soft, you could actually just stamp everything without looking and still make $70-80 each day after deductions. Also, it turns out that paying penalties is as optional as the rent, and as a result I managed to get $815 in savings at the end of the 8 days, with all of my family "OK".<br>There wasn't even any consequences for doing so, the only people that went on to cause trouble had legitimate documents anyway...<br>
</blockquote>
<br>This is a good point and something I never thought to try. I'll probably end the game after 5 penalties or something.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Finally, if you play the game through again and try refusing those Kolchians entry, it becomes pretty obvious that the game is forcing you to let one through...<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I don't have to make the paperwork actually Kolechian, which might help. But really there are certain scripted things that will play out the same each time no matter what. A proper endless mode separate from the story mode should help with replayability.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Perhaps instead of deducting money continually, after 4-5 penalties the day ends prematurely due to the immigration inspector needing "counseling".<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Yup, that sounds good.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">Oh, and the end-of-day tally is buggy for me and a friend, and text appears over the button to go to the next day. Do you think that implementing a scrollbox for that would help?<br>

<br>I hate scroll boxes but I'll figure something out. Maybe drop to a smaller font if there are too many items.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">And last thing! Will there be hotkeys to easily navigate through documents?<br>

<br>I'm not too crazy about keyboard shortcuts and I'm not even sure how that would work to navigate documents. I've thought about simplifying this aspect of the game a couple times, but shuffling things around is a pretty critical element of game's mechanics.

              <span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Sniping</b></span><br>(Ignore the double cursor. My only LICEcap complaint)<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gYlpbIg.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I wrestled for a while with how to handle the sniping. There were a brief few microseconds when I thought to cut it. Those moments passed without incident and now we're left with this.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The Problem</b></span><br>The problem is that sniping with a mouse is way too easy. Previously I suggested it might change from a cross-hair to an aim-line or some other silly thing to increase the difficulty. Obviously that's a terrible idea but I still wanted to make it harder.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Sorted It</b></span><br>So this is my solution. The sniping is still easy. What's hard is getting the gun. It's not just about moving your cursor up to the top any more. You have to be fast. In order to access a gun, you first need a key. You'll get these through the course of the story. Once you've got a key, it sits on your desk wherever you put it, buried under the papers, unused. When the moment strikes, you'll need to find the key on your desk, unlock the gun drawer using the key, select the gun, then shoot the runner/trespasser/enemy. If it sounds like a pain in the ass that's because it is. It uses the same standard interface of paper shuffling and drag and drop, but with an extreme time limit. The level of panic is just right. By the time you get the gun out, there's only a second or two to aim and shoot before the grenade is thrown.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Armaments</b></span><br>There'll be just two guns, unlocked as the game progresses:<br><br><b>Tranquilizer rifle</b><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>3 rounds</li>
<li>less precise aiming</li>
<li>non-lethal drop in one hit (death animation above is wrong, it'll be bloodless)</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Sniper rifle</b><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>2 rounds</li>
<li>precise reticule</li>
<li>kills in one hit (bloody)</li>
</ul>
<br>The tranquilize gun comes first so you'll always have the option for non-lethal force.

<br>Gotcha. Thanks for the info guys. I can see now that the leap at this moment from just stamping to being gated by inspection is too much. Citations and bulletin hints or not. Gonna put some more thought into how I can lower this barrier, smooth out this bump, and nail this metaphor.

              <span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Suddenly, Mods</b></span><br><br>If you've poked around in any of the beta's asset directories, you may know that all the game's assets are editable. Part of this is because Haxe/NME doesn't have an asset packaging system built in. Part of it is because I thought it would be cool if people could see how the game was set up.<br><br>While I never planned it, people have already started modding the game. This is a weird feeling for a game creator; especially when the game isn't done yet. There are some cool mods and some tasteless ones. Given the game's subject matter, this isn't surprising.<br><br>For the latest beta, I decided to address the issue. There were two options:<br><br>    <b>1.</b> Lock down the assets and prevent modding<br>    <b>2.</b> Support mods properly<br><br>I first implemented #1. That meant writing a build process to bundle/encrypt the assets and an in-game module to load/decrypt them. Haxe/NME made this amazingly easy and it really drove home the power of the language and tools.<br><br>I was pretty set with that when I came to my senses. Once the assets are out (as in the previous betas), it makes no sense to suddenly lock them down. It's a dick move, even. If I liked a game enough to spend my time modding it, I'd be pretty pissed if the next build disabled mods. Even if they were unofficial. I got my start in games with Quake mods and have some understanding of the effort and devotion that goes into modding.<br><br>Ok, so I decided #2 was a better choice in the end. At least for the pre-release builds.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Proper Support</b></span><br><br>Adding proper mod support wasn't that hard. There are 3 important things in my opinion:<br><br><b>1. Make them easy to distribute</b><br>Again, Haxe/NME pulled through here. There's a great exsiting api to extract zip files in Haxe. Using that lets modders zip up their asset directory into one nice .ppmod file that's easy to download. A .ppmod can by played by saving it next to PapersPlease.exe and drag+dropping it onto the executable.<br><br><b>2. Don't require overwriting original assets</b><br>The currently available mods are basically just a zip file of the entire beta, including the exe and all (edited) assets. This is wasteful and unsafe. I know I'm less likely to run a strange exe than I am to run an asset-only mod. Working over the original files is also a painful way to develop a mod and it's better to have a set of "override" assets instead. This allows including only the edited assets in a mod, which increases the likelihood that it'll work across multiple versions of the game.<br><br><b>3. Assign visible credit</b><br>This is the most important for me and there are two parts. First, it has to be clear that I didn't create the modded content. This is especially true when someone makes a tasteless mod. I don't want people to make a connection when seeing one of those and "Created by Lucas Pope" on the title screen. Second, good mods are a lot of work. If someone puts in the time and effort to make a mod, I want them to get credit. When running the latest beta, the game displays the mod name/author on the title screen and links to the author's website.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Reaction</b></span><br><br>We'll see. Even with a more complete modding system, it takes a few additional steps to create a mod now. Some people are already complaining about this so I guess you can't win sometimes.<br><br>Hopefully a few good mods come out of this, but for now I'm turning my focus back to finishing the game.

              <br>Thanks to everybody for the comments. I'm gonna dump a huge response here. It's getting harder and harder to respond to people individually as the game gets more exposure. This is a problem I always wished to have <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"><br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>fleur: Looking through this thread, I am wondering why the player must get a rifle, necessarily?</b></span><br>It's a gameplay thing that I'm stubbornly attached to. That's basically all there is to it. I haven't finished integrating it though, so it may still be cut if I find it doesn't work.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>zede: Are you going to release this on mobile as well?</b></span><br>I'm plotting it. After PC/Mac, and likely only iPad due to the size constraints.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>John Sandoval: it wasn't clear to me till about day 5 that i had to/was able to feed my family</b></span><br>I've added a message about this on the first day's night screen. (final branch only, not in betas)<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>Comrade Beric: Point of fact, I'm still unsure of exactly how I get paid.</b></span><br>Yeah the game is intentionally vague about this. And a lot of other things I guess. I may put a small number on the night screen somewhere to incidate how many people you processed. With that it'll be possible to deduce (without being told directly) how the money is awarded.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>arkhometha: I detained him [the pimp] and the newspaper gave me he the ringleader was arrested but the girls still died. I thought the blame was on me.</b></span><br>Are you sure about this? There are two exclusive scenarios:<br><br>- Detain him and get this news: <br>   @ News Human Trafficking Ring Shut Down! \ Grestin Checkpoint Officer Nabs Mastermind \ Face:M-11-12-8-5<br>- Approve/Deny him and get this news:<br>   @ News Dancers At Grestin Club Found Dead! \ Newly Immigrated Girls Victims Of Human Trafficking<br><br>Are you saying you saw both pieces of news after detaining him?<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>crazysam: Can you share how you handled full screen / windowed switching and most importantly, window resizing?</b></span><br>There is a top-level sprite (child of the stage) that contains all the display objects and handles the resize message:<br><pre><br>   public static var kPixelWidth = 570;<br>   public static var kPixelHeight = 320;<br>   ...<br>   private function applySizing()<br>   {<br>      ...<br>      // choose resMult to fit stage size<br>      var mult = 1;<br>      while (true)<br>      {<br>         if (kPixelWidth*(mult+1) &gt; stageWidth) break;<br>         if (kPixelHeight*(mult+1) &gt; stageHeight) break;<br>         mult++;<br>      }<br>      resMult = mult;<br>      scaleX = mult;<br>      scaleY = mult;<br>      x = (stageWidth - kPixelWidth*scaleX)/2;<br>      y = (stageHeight - kPixelHeight*scaleY)/2<br>      ...<br>   }<br></pre>
<br><br>That puts the play area in the center of the screen at the highest possible whole-pixel scale. This often doesn't fill the screen, so there's also a set of 4 black bitmaps (also children of the stage) arranged around the play area to mask it.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>Arhemont: So basically all the actions are wrong. ...

You can try the alpha build to see for yourself. In that version you are cited but it doesn't list the actual mistake. There are some posts earlier in the devlog discussing it. I'll address the "inspector inspector" at some point in-game.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>szron: Pages of a passport ... Computer system ... "Secondary" ...</b></span><br>I originally envisioned checking previous VISAs but, as Armageddon said, felt the complexity wasn't worth it. Also, the game originally did have a computer telex system for getting information from the Ministry of Admission. It was cut a pretty long time ago. I think there are a few devlog posts about it but the summary is that it wasn't needed after I implemented the current fingerprinting system. Finally, I think a 2nd round of interrogation would slow the game down too much.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>whyareall: A suggestion that someone made a while back that didn't seem to get notice was right clicking for discrepancies, instead of having to pull up the big, screen-covering thing that blocks you from moving documents around and wastes time.</b></span><br>That was my suggestion <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0">. It would just be a shortcut for entering inspect mode and selecting with one click. Inspecting will always be a separate mode where you can't move the documents. I haven't implemented it yet because it's such a minor optimization that I haven't felt the need.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>SliceOfDog: [bug with rejecting/denying everyone]</b></span><br>This'll get fixed with escalating penalties. Around 5 in one day will be enough to game-over that night.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><b>SliceOfDog: [having a smaller rulebook that pins]</b></span><br>There are many ways I could make the interface more optimal but as mentioned before I'm happy with the current level of required paper shuffling.

I think it's important to make the player look up to the top area every once in a while to click the booth. This is mainly why I put the button there (instead of keeping it on the desk).<br>

<br>An interesting thing I found very early is that the more errors an entrant has, the easier it is. The beta is currently limited to at-most one error per entrant. As you guys have noticed that makes it too predictable so I'm changing it to handle this case better. Documents revealed later may have errors in the final version.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Beta 0.5.13</b></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><a href="http://dukope.com#ppl" target="_blank"><b>GRAB IT HERE</b></a></span><br><br>Just a few bug fixes.<br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li> No new content.</li>
<li>  Show helpful error when trying to run without enough OpenGL.</li>
<li>  Fixed some issues with continuing a game in progress.</li>
<li>  Fixed "Invalid News0" citation message.</li>
<li>  Fixed crash when continuing from day 9.</li>
<li>  Fixed double-detain bug on scripted entrants.</li>
<li>  Corrected citation penalty amount text.</li>
<li>  Removed Jorji and made day 3 a much more casual-friendly experience.</li>
<li>  Just kidding. It seems the last fix worked. No more changes to day 3.</li>
</ul>
<br>There was one major issue I wanted to fix with this build. On some people's machines, the rendering is totally screwed up and the game eventually crashes. Turns out it was related to missing OpenGL drivers. The game now prints a useful error message in this case.<br><br>Hopefully there's nothing majorly wrong with this build as I'm hoping to move off the beta and start the push for final release.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Endless Mode</b></span><br><br>An endless mode is something I've been mulling since the beginning, and it's a common request.

At the very least, I'll respond to comments here. And I'm planning to keep a private devlog of my progress. Something I can post here after the game's release.

              Holy shit! Thanks everybody! That was fast! I'm thinking to write some nonsense on why I think it got greenlit in such a short time. I planned nothing but in hindsight might be able to explain it.<br><br>-------------<br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@gene123:</b></span> [Ideas]</span><br>There are some good ideas here. The reducing food costs was planned, but I completely forgot about it. I'll definitely do that. Luggage is something I cut for good after implementing the search system. It just turned out to not be necessary enough to be worth the work. The other stuff is cool, but not quite what I have in mind.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@qqqbbb:</b></span>  [rightclick drag papers, slavic gender names]</span><br>Someone else suggested right-click for dragging papers back. My response was that I don't want to add a whole new drag mode to optimize out a part of the game that I think is important. For the names, I actually have some gender consideration for the names, but I guess it could be wrong. The problem unfortunately will only get worse when I integrate the user-submitted names. There's over 10,000 of them now so I'll probably just punt on any kind of gender correctness.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@arkhometha:</b></span>  [newspaper bug]</span><br>Thank you for trying to reproduce this bug. Someone contacted me with a video showing the glitch. Basically, you have to correlate his name with the card, then when the detain button pops up, click it and immediately give him the card. The detain button will pop up a second time. If you hit it then, the newspaper will show both stories.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@Gila:</b></span>  This kind of takes the challenge out of the game and reduces the replayability value at least for me</span><br>The main story mode will only have a small amount of randomness. I'm more inclined to get the narrative right than to make it replayable. Hopefully the endless mode can satisfy that itch.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@Angrytemplar:</b></span>  For some reason medicine didn't work</span><br>Medicine doesn't immediately cure sickness. I'm not sure about the exact stats but it can take a few days to get better. Could this be what was happening?<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@Monolith:</b></span>  Consider adding a one-off immigrant who wants to buy your "dirty" photos.</span><br>SSSHHHH.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@GepardenK:</b></span>  [family stuff]</span><br>I'm 80% set on the current family setup. But people are pretty consistent in asking for more. So I'm going to keep thinking about it. I doubt I'll go as far as adding a shop menu. I've been thinking about ways to expand what's there while maintaining the vagueness that I like.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Re: Sniping</b></span><br>Trust me, you will want to pull the trigger and it will feel good when you hit your target. I've worked out a story arc that's deeply integrated with the sniping. This is my favorite arc so far so the matter is completely settled in my mind.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Re: The Eagle</b></span><br>As JohnnyG says, the eagle is not only a fascist mark. The world is overflowing with countries that use the eagle. I realize it's not normally associated with communism but it's a more eye-catching government-y symbol for me than a star or sickle. The original eagle was based on the Romanian shield. I wanted something more crazy and so switched to the current mix of screaming bird and American eagle.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Re: Ideas/Suggestions</b></span><br>Part of my goal for this game is to do a lot with very little. It's basically a single-screen game with a mostly-static interface. I've worked out enough of the story to think that I can make a good game using only the elements that are already there. That means I probably won't add new modes like night-time duty, walking-to-work, or pulling-guns-on-entrants. I know this sounds short-sighted, but please just give me the benefit of the doubt. <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> There is still a lot of unexplored territory in only the features available in the beta. There's more I haven't shown and I want to explore that thoroughly before adding anything else.

It basically depends on if there's a need to introduce a minor mechanic complication later in the game. Criminal fingerprints are a cool idea.

I have lots of cool attacks planned for the final and that's all I'll say about that <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> For reusing names, I can't think of a good way to correlate an already-used name without a full list of processed names and I don't really want to do that.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@metasynthie:</b></span> [totally awesome stuff about different run styles, can't verify gender with fingerprints]</span><br>Wow!

I'm a huge Doom speedrun fan but never expected to see that sorta thing for my own game <img src="https://forums.tigsource.com/Smileys/derek/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0"> Some of those won't be viable when I add the escalating penalties. But it kinda gives me an idea for some achievements. Showing gender on the fingerprint card is a good idea. Will try that.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@Willowcat:</b></span> [family member job, weather, more corruption, censorship]</span><br>There will be lots of scripted night-time events affecting your finances. Family members getting jobs isn't one of them, but there's similar stuff planned. I'm undecided on weather. A couple people have suggested it but so far I haven't felt it's needed. The beta is around one-third of the game so you can expect plenty of interesting and corrupt individuals to follow. And finally, there will be an option to cover up the strip-search nudity.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@TacoDeBoss:</b></span> [didn't understand inspecting notes or enabling detention]</span><br>Can you tell me when/how you realized you could inspect that stuff and enable detaining? Knowing that may help me figure out a good way to teach the concept.<br><br><span style="color: teal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>@babac:</b></span> [interrogation, nudity, don't like issuing city]</span><br>Interrogation can sometimes lead to the entrant producing a missing document. If you don't care about that, then currently there's no difference. As a practical matter, the nudity needs to be optional. I'm totally fine giving up a little bite from the game's message for practicality. You're not the first person to complain about the issuing cities. I think TB even explicitly ignored them. Again, this is one of those things (along with the too-small desk and lack of hotkeys) that I really enjoy about the game. An inspector needs to know lots of random facts. And the only cost of not knowing is time to look it up.<br><br><hr>

              I'm not gonna post any more spoiler-ish stuff here, but there's still some dev things I can share.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Testing</b></span><br><br>As a one-person (and before that, two-person) developer, one issue that's always hard to deal with is testing. Having worked at big and small studios, I know how useful a skilled testing department can be. I also know how expensive they are and how hard it is to find good people. <br><br>Instead of all that people-related stuff, I usually try to figure out a way to test the game myself. Without actually sitting down and playing it forever. One common technique is to create an autoplay or 'soak' mode where the game can basically play itself. This lends itself well to procedural puzzle games and is what we did for Helsing's Fire. I wrote a simple bot that could play the game flawlessly and we set it running overnight during the last few weeks of the project. This was really useful in tracking down holes in the puzzle generation (finding unsolvable puzzles due to a logic bug somewhere), and plugging memory leaks (a common point of failure for iOS games).<br><br>Papers Please has hooks to do something similar. I could write a bot to move the mouse/click buttons, group these actions, combine groups, build scripts, etc. Some of this work was already done to automate the trailer capturing. But to take it all the way to autplaying would actually be a lot of work. And at this point I don't even want to test these things. What I really want to test is the high-level progression, story elements, and money balancing.<br><br>So instead, I split out the game's logic from the UI and built a separate fast-play UI that uses the same logic engine:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qSeIYEf.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>This screen lets me quickly play through each encounter. Either in order for a given day, or skipping around between entrants. It's useless for the tactile UI mechanics, checking animations, gameplay pressures from the small desk, etc. What it's great for though is testing the story and progression. And since I'm implementing the full game's story now, this fast-play mode is critical for experimentation.<br><br>When the story implementation is done I'll extend this mode to full autoplay for balance testing. I was never quite sure how useful this would be, but seeing <b>metasynthie</b>'s posts about play style gave me the needed kick. Using some basic rules about what to do for different encounters, I'll script "play style" bots and send them through the game. One bot may deny all Kolechians. One may make a mistake on the first new rule encounter and never after. One may deny everybody. If I build enough of these simple styles, I should be able to set them loose to get a feel how the game will balance out for different players. This should also be a good way to incorporate an "easy" difficulty for the less-skilled styles.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Story</b></span><br><br>Most of the story threads are done so now the task is to arrange them (in spoiler-avoiding low res):<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I6fivCJ.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Right after taking this picture I copied everything into a spreadsheet to make editing easier.<br><br>My typical process for designing high-level game progression goes something like this:<br><br>1. Create a bunch of little pieces.<br>2. Make a grid.<br>3. Fill the grid with pieces.<br><br>From the very beginning I've been creating little pieces. For Papers Please a "piece" is an encounter, a character, a story thread, a document idea, a puzzle idea, an attack method, etc. I've got a lot of these and now is the time to arrange them. I want to front-load some cool stuff to hook the player, expand on longer stories in the middle, add new elements to maintain interest, and ramp things up to a climax at the end.<br><br>Once the initial pieces are laid out, I can easily rearrange them or add new ones to fill the gaps. I really like this part of development because it's when the whole game comes together. It's also hopelessly formulaic. I've tried designing by feel before and unfortunately it just doesn't work for me. I find it much more natural to impose a hard structure and systematically break problems up into small pieces, then combine them afterwards.

I mean mainly situations where you need to take fingerprints and they turn out to be fine - it'd be interesting if that could happen, but there'd <i>still</i> be a problem somewhere.

<br>Yeah. This was mentioned in the last few pages. The counterintuitive thing is that more errors makes the game easier, not harder. So in general, each immigrant will have at most one thing wrong. But this makes certain encounters too predictable (immigrant hands over a document after forgetting it) so I'll add an exception in those cases. In the final version, there may be errors in the newly-provided docs.

              <span style="color: maroon;"><b>@Phugmeister:</b> [tokens, empy spaces on night screen, issuing cities]</span><br><br>There are only 3 tokens in the beta, so you got them all. The empty spaces will come up in the final game. And as RobRendell mentions, the issuing cities aren't as ignorable when the penalties are escalating. I still haven't gotten to actually balancing the escalation, but my goal is to force the player to think long and hard about ignoring any piece of information.<br><br><span style="color: maroon;"><b>@Frostiken:</b> [fingerprints]</span><br><br>You need to compare the fingerprints. Sometimes they don't match. I was surprised to see a few playthrough videos where people give the fingerprint card to the entrant, then completely ignore it when it's given back with actual fingerprints. I've added some text to the identity record to hopefully make this a little more clear:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YVTJRPq.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>New Domain</b></span><br><br>I dragged my feet about registering a proper domain for the game so when I went to get paperspleasegame.com it was already taken.

It was written from scratch and took only a couple hours. Surprisingly, the hardest part was getting drag-n-drop working right on iOS. I had to add a little javascript touchevent handler to cancel the normal page-scroll events. And due to whatever quirk of Jeash (Haxe/NME's javascript flash API library), the canvas element needs to be the first thing on the page to get the correct mouse coordinates on a touch device. So if you play it on a mobile browser, the top "PAPERS, PLEASE" title thing is removed in order to put the canvas div at the very top.<br><br>Even with these few hiccups I'm amazed with how smooth it went. I definitely wouldn't have bothered if it required writing pure javascript, which I loathe. So add another point to the Haxe/NME column.

<br>This is one of the things I've fixed since the beta. Basically exactly as you suggest. Items that can't be compared aren't selectable. The fingerprint sheet is a good example but there's a bunch of similar cases.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">
<b>Edit:</b> And it'd be nice if the citation could fit "Fingerprints did not match" if the player got to that point and still let them through.<br>

<br>Good idea. I think it currently says something like "Identity Record: Invalid Fingerprints"... "Fingerprints do not match" would be a lot clearer.

But it doesn't mention that the fingerprint check failed as well.

<br>The fingerprints match there. The problem is that the alias doesn't, so the id card listing a different name must be forged.

              <blockquote class="blockquote">...Tutorial stuff...<br>
</blockquote>
<br>There are a lot of good arguments for a tutorial. But as a gamer I vastly prefer to learn things on the fly, even under pressure. The game will make it easy to go back and replay the day so you can always look at this as an implicit tutorial. I found myself doing this a few times on a recent play through and it was kinda fun to try optimizing a day before moving on.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">By the way, I don't recommend watching Sips' (Yogscast) video on the game. I couldn't watch through it.<br>

<br>Yeah I actually can't watch more than a few minutes of any PP let's plays. Combination of horror at all the things I don't explain well enough and general fatigue from working on the game.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">With the modding functionality, is there any way to add more days to the beta?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>I don't remember the exact status of the beta anymore. It may be possible but there's also a good chance it's hard-coded.<br><br><blockquote class="blockquote">After taking fingerprints, I tried to match "no known aliases" text from a fingerprint slip with an ID card name (which was different from the name in passport), but it shown "NO CORELLATION". Shouldn't that work?<br>
</blockquote>
<br>This should work, yeah. At least, it works in the current dev builds so probably something was broken for beta.<br><br><hr>
<br><b><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.3em;">First Playthrough</span></b><br><br>I just got to the point where the game can be played from start to finish with no placeholder content (missing only the ending sequences). In total it took just over 4 hours. Even though I felt rushed the whole time, 4 hours is a little longer than I intended. The general gameplay progression was pretty good but unfortunately some of the longer story threads fell flat.<br><br>I'll be taking time this week to flesh those threads out more. Hopefully I can get the "thriller" part of it to come out better.

<br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Done!</b></span><br><br>I made it! It's still summer! Thank fuck!<br><br><i>Papers, Please</i> is all set to release next week, August 8th on Steam, GOG.com, and the Humble Store. Pre-orders are open now on <b><a href="http://papersplea.se" target="_blank">PapersPlea.se</a></b><br><br>My apologies for the silence on here. These last months have been completely insane with finishing, testing, fixing, tweaking, polishing, signing contracts, making store assets, redoing websites, setting up support systems, check user-submitted names, and stressing the fuck out.<br><br>Pre-orders open today and I'm actually still working on small things for the game. The final build needs to be boxed and shipped by Monday morning to hit the Thursday release.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>From the Beta</b></span><br><br>I took feedback from the open beta and tried my best to fix everything while adding as much content as I could. Originally I had planned on 30 days for the full game but when laying out all the events (by far the hardest part of the development for me), I just couldn't fit it all in. So the final game has 31 days. <br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>20 Endings</b></span><br><br>There's 20 endings in all, which is honestly way too many. Adding a new ending became a logical and elegant way to handle all the different things the player could do. 12 of the endings are considered "early" in that they appear before the 31 days are up. The remaining 8 are attainable at the end of day 31. Which ending you get is dependent on the decisions you make during the days and nights. The branching save system makes it easy to go back and try different things.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Endless Mode</b></span><br><br>The full version features a separate "Endless" mode that's unlocked by reaching a certain Story mode ending (or finding the unlock code on the net). There's 3 game-types (Timed, Perfection, and Endurance) and 4 rule-sets (which documents and rules are in effect at the checkpoint) to choose from and Steam leaderboards for the score rankings.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Launching</b></span><br><br>I've done my best to coordinate everything (press emails, twitter announcement, this post, greenlight update, website update, stores going live, etc, etc) to make the announcement today. Honestly I've been pretty overwhelmed by this part of the project. Making games is great fun until the last 10%.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Support</b></span><br><br>The thing that scares me the most about releasing this game is the support. Mainly, I'm worried about someone buying the game and having it not run properly on their system. I fixed a lot of issues from the beta but wasn't able to run a complete system test on the final build. My plan is to work as diligently and quickly as possible to fix any issues that come up after release. Steam makes it very easy to update a game in the wild which is great for a small developer like me. GOG and Humble Store are a little harder, but I've at least set up a pipeline that lets me create update builds quickly and easily. There'll also be a support page where I can put common problems and their solutions and players having issues can fill out a form to request support directly.<br>

<br>You know I'm not sure. Humble Store gives the biggest cut but yeah, that means it won't get a feature on Steam.

Coming up with these was really fun; spy document handoff, nosy reporter, time bomb defusing, corrupt guard, etc. The task of tying all that together with a logical progression and interesting story was not as fun. I wanted the gameplay to evolve at a good pace but also to motivate each new mechanic with a story element. And with lots of these things to lay out, it's also important to avoid having too many things happen at once that can misdirect or confuse the player. <br><br>As an example, there's a secret document hand-off encounter early in the game. You get handed two identical documents and need to keep them straight:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yy0N04a.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>Implementing this was easy but there was no clear place to put it in the game. The event involves a bulletin callout, 2 travelers (the spy and his follower), and 2 documents. It's a pretty heavy event actually because once you read the bulletin, you're on the lookout for the first spy and his follower; it somewhat consumes the player's headspace. This meant that I didn't want it to overlap with any other days where you have an important bulletin message, when you're expecting someone specific, or when you have another document handoff. It finally wound up on the same day you meet Calensk. Now the problem is that as soon as you read the bulletin about a spy coming, this military-looking guy walks up. Naturally you'd think he was the spy. If I had any other choice I would've moved this encounter or Calensk's intro but out of the 31 days there was no other place. I ended up just letting these events overlap but made one small dialog addition to clear up any confusion. When Calensk walks in for the first time, the inspector asks "Are you the spy?", to which he responds "What? No". <b>Ship it.</b><br><br>This is one example but there were lots of cases like this where I had to be very careful with the arrangement. Each event, encounter, mechanic, introduction, etc required coordination with everything else. I started by layings things out on paper but that didn't last long. Eventually I do what I normally do and wrote a tool to help:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AmtXtjzl.png" alt="" border="0">  <br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/AmtXtjz.png" target="_blank">Full-size</a><br><br>This is the basic story layout tool. Each column is a day and the boxes represent mechanics, rules, news stories, travelers, bulletins, etc. I define the dependencies in a simple text format then load it up here and slide the boxes around to visualize how everything will play out. Some events have multiple boxes spanning several rows and several days. Once everything was set up I could quickly see empty or crowded spaces and tweak things accordingly.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Economy</b></span><br>For the beta release, the game had a very simple economy. I didn't put much thought into it at the time and there were lame ways to exploit your income. For the final game I knew I'd need better planning to put the average player under constant money pressure. Again, this is something I tackled with a custom tool.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ijJD0EK.png" alt="" border="0">  <br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nbVRBuN.gif" target="_blank">Full-size animated gif</a><br><br>The days are listed from top to bottom this time. Each row represents one day and has the news stories, processing (T=traveler, P=penalty, D=detain), special encounters (bribes, story events), nighttime messages, and expenses. Each element is a button and allows quickly testing different scenarios by toggling each effect on and off. For example, clicking the [P2] on the first line will simulate getting 2 penalties on day one. That effect will propagate through the entire game to show nighttime earnings, adjusted events, and even when the family would start dying. <br><br>This economy simulator was one of my more useful tools made for the game. The stuff I learned with it fed back into the story layout to let me know when it would be good to add a bribery or other money-affecting event. The niece event was laid out this way. I saw a dip below zero on one day and came up with the story for her to appear with her mom's savings as relief.<br><br><br><hr>

              <span style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Stuff That Was Cut</b></span><br>One of the most valuable lessons I learned working in AAA is that nothing is above being cut. Developing (and finishing) a game is just as much about removing things as it is adding them. Cutting stuff out that doesn't add to the experience or when the payoff doesn't match up with the cost of implementation is actually something I enjoy. It keeps me constantly thinking about the core of what makes a game fun or interesting.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Baggage</b></span><br>From the very beginning I envisioned a simple baggage-inspecting mechanic. Basically just like the body scanner but with randomized contents and a gun or two every once in a while. I kept putting off the implementation until eventually it wasn't needed. The game was already fun without it and adding it would've been a sizable task. Instead, I made it a point that baggage is not allowed so it sorta fit well with the narrative.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Booth Shenanigans</b></span><br>The booth screen was supposed to have more going on. The shutter switch is some evidence of that; there were plans to have immigrants pull a gun or otherwise threaten the inspector. When this happened you'd have to close the shutter quickly or pull your own gun or something. Like the baggage though, I held off implementing it long enough to decide that it wasn't necessary. Normally I'd remove any vestiges of a cut feature but in this case I left the shutter switch in. It's a fun little thing to role play and it comes in handy for triggering a hint early in the game. I still get comments about the pointlessness of this switch though. Maybe I should've removed it.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>UV Seals</b></span><br>I think these are mentioned briefly in the devlog somewhere. The document seals were supposed to grow more involved. As part of the general progression of complexity, I wanted to add a special UV light in the late game that would be needed to verify a new type of document seal. The idea was to have only a small area of the desk lit by UV light. You'd have to move the document into this area to reveal a second "hidden" image in the seal that needed to match the rulebook. It seemed like a cool way to increase the difficulty and would've been a nice technical effect. Unfortunately and once again, this feature got pushed back far enough that it fell off the edge. Unlike some of the other cut stuff, I held out on this one for a bit longer though. I was ready to add it in until the last few weeks, when I'd laid out enough of the story and progression to find there was no room left for it.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Search Photo Confiscation</b></span><br>This is the latest major cut I can remember. An early assumption was that the game would have both the search mechanic (which left naked photos on your desk) and a way to sell those photos for money. There's even a devlog post where I'm wink wink hinting at this, as if it's not an obvious extension of the search mechanic. This is basic low hanging fruit when dealing with the concepts of security and privacy wrapped up in body scanning. Surely those security personnel are keeping and/or profitting from naked pictures of people. Now you can too! The mechanic worked like this:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kncyymO.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I didn't want (too many) documents crowding your desk so I created the confiscation drawer. Search photos would automatically move to your confiscation drawer and stay there until the end of the day. Unsavory characters would come in and offer you 5 credits per photo, which you could drag out of the drawer and give to them. Easy.<br><br>The confiscation drawer was a nice solution to the technical problem of having a full day's worth of unique documents loaded in memory. As soon as the person walks out of the booth, the custom photo is unloaded and the confiscation envelope changes to become a generic "closed envelope" with some descriptive text.<br><br>Everything here was completely implemented before I started laying out the final days of the game. That's when I noticed a few problems. <br><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>Why are only passports and search photos confiscatable?</li>
<li>Passport confiscation is a critical end-game revelation.</li>
<li>Search photo confiscation is a setup for a few obvious (and superfluous) encounters.</li>
<li>All the rules about confiscation have to mention both photos and passports.</li>
<li>Search photos appear very early in the game but passport confiscation only makes sense near the end.</li>
</ul>
<br>The big problem for me was a softening of the focus on passport confiscation. Taking someone's passport is a clear escalation on the things-are-getting-serious scale. This sets up the scenario of having your own family's passports taken and leads directly into the end game. Selling someone's bodyscan photo is just another notch on the creeper-security-agent-is-selling-my-naked-pics scale. Under the original scenario, the drawer appeared along with the ability to search, near the start of the game. This meant you could confiscate photos for a long time when suddenly you'd have to start taking passports too. There'd be no obvious UI hint for this change (the drawer was almost always there, just now you should put passports in too). From a mechanics and progression perspective, I found there was a lot more impact if the confiscation drawer was introduced for the purpose of taking passports. <br><br>Giving up for-sure features like this can be hard, especially after they're implemented. Whenever you have a bunch of issues pile up related to a specific feature though, it's worth taking a step back and asking yourself what you gain or lose by cutting it.<br><br>Ultimately, even though I'd already implemented photo confiscation, it was an easy choice to remove it. Taking it out gave me a better game in every way, leaving the concept of confiscation limited to passports. Probably my favorite cut.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The Overwatcher</b></span><br>If you go back through the devlog, you can find some discussion of how weird it is to get detailed citations for mistakes. As if someone is watching over your shoulder. Why not have <i>that</i> guy check the passports? This bothered me for most of the project and I considered a few different ways to handle it. My original plan was to incorporate this "overwatch" theme deeply into the core gameplay and story.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5g70G13.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>In the beta, you can see the not-yet-functional overwatch light on the stamp bar. It wasn't going to be explained until much later, but the overwatcher worked in shifts. When this light was on, he was watching; if it turned off, he wasn't. If you wanted to approve someone with a mistake on their passport, you could avoid a citation by waiting until the light went out to quickly stamp/return the documents. With the overwatcher part of the core mechanics like this, he was also going to show up in the story. Sergiu was originally supposed to have some kind of connection with the overwatcher. I hadn't worked out any details but figured there was potential for favors to be exchanged. I also wanted one of the EZIC agents work his way into the overwatch position with your help. If you approved a certain agent, a few days later you'd receive a printout letting you know that EZIC is now in control of the overwatch post and all the rules have changed. That would've created an interesting situation where the printed bulletin and rulebook meant nothing and the player had to work against a different set of secret EZIC commands.<br><br>So that was all well and good; lots of potential. I really like this kind of subversion of expectations, where the rules change suddenly or the player is faced with something unexpected and has to change their thinking. <br><br>After working through a few scenarios though, I was left overall with a worse game than before. The moment the script flips is all well and cool but it's at the cost of everything before and after. If the overwatcher works in obvious shifts then all the sob story immigrants just become a case of waiting a few seconds for the light to go out. It changes the focus from the interesting stuff to watching for a light to turn off.<br><br>After that realization, I considered ditching the light mechanic but keeping the tangible overwatcher. There'd be no way to "cheat" the citations but I could keep the EZIC overwatch-takeover concept and have all the rules change in the late game. Maybe that could've worked with a lot of careful thought but in the end I was left feeling that it weakened a central premise of the game that you're a powerless cog in an uncaring machine. If the overwatcher is a guy that can be so easily reached then maybe the system isn't so overbearing. Unaddressed and untouchable though, it becomes an implicit force outside of any influence. I feel this works better for both the gameplay and the story. In the final game there's only a touch of mystery behind the citations but it's (I hope) quickly accepted as an implicit construct.<br><br>Even beyond these two (good) reasons, messing with the citation system subverts the right-or-wrong judgement tied to the core mechanic of finding discrepancies. Once that judgement is abandoned, the discrepancy hunt falls apart completely. That was especially decisive for me since I strongly believe in the importance of gameplay systems in effective interactive media. <b>This cut goes all the way to the top.</b><br><br>Also I removed the overwatch light. People were clicking it like a button.<br><br><br><hr>

<span style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>One More Thing That Was Cut</b></span><br>Forgot something...<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Obristan Escape Sequence</b></span><br>Long before relase, as a way to announce the final price for Papers Please, I created a <a href="http://papersplea.se/pricegame" target="_blank">simple HTML5 game</a>:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BEGSGB2.png" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Note: this is a random face sprite, not the player character from the final game</i><br><br>You give this guy your documents and a small bribe equaling the price of the game. Bribe him too little and he denies you; too much and he arrests you; just right and you'll get your entry granted =&gt; you figured out how much Papers Please will cost on release.<br><br>This was more work than you could really justify for announcing the price of something. That's because this interaction was also intended to be included in the final game. When you and your family escape to Obristan after day 31, you were supposed to play this minigame again while passing through the Obristan checkpoint as an immigrant. You'd go through an interactive sequence of waiting in line, approaching the counter from the other side, giving the inspector your docs, and sweating it. This was a nice "tables have turned" payoff for the entire game.<br><br>The downfall here was that it was too much work for just one ending. This price game was done, but the waiting in line, entering the booth, the result screens were all to-do. And it wasn't really interactive anyways. Did I want people to fail at this point, by offering the wrong docs/bribe? How would that be handled? Would they have to play the final day through to try again?<br><br>Eeventually, I decided that the best approach for the game endings was a generic system that could be used for everything. The picture-with-text system used in the intro worked great for that and was much easier to implement. I restructured the Obristan immigration sequence using this much simpler system and kinda liked it. It also lined up better with my neutral treatment of the endings. Adding a special minigame just for the Obristan escape ending would've given it extra weight, implying that it was more correct than any of the other day-31 endings; which wasn't the case.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/z8duck9.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><i>The facial hair is for warmth.

              <blockquote class="blockquote">I thought Obristan being so easy to immigrate to was a way of showing how ridiculously complicated your own job was. No checks, no questions, it felt like the game was exposing the overly bureaucratic Arstotzka border control checkpoints.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>Yeah this was a happy result of changing to the simple ending style. The full interactive segment would've been much closer to Arstotzkan-level bureaucracy in order to force the tension. Switching to just image+text gave me the freedom to treat it differently.<br><br>I especially like how Obristan doesn't give a shit about reason for entry. It's almost like a complete retrospective commentary on the entire game in just two lines of dialog.

<span style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Stuff That Was Added at the Last Second</b></span><br>Sometimes when you cut something, a big hole is left behind. Or, after bringing a bunch of different elements together near the end of development you run into stubborn problems you couldn't foresee and that you can't cut your way out of. I hit a few of these. I tried my best to avoid adding things near the end but it still happened. (A lot apparently, this is a long postmortem entry.)<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Reason for Denial Stamp</b></span><br>I consider this one of the better late additions. During the beta, a common question would come up: "Do I even need to interrogate a discrepancy?" The answer for the beta is "No." For a long time, the answer for the full game was also "No." There was a similar issue with detention, where it was never required and had no concrete benefit in the beta. I changed that by adding Calensk and giving you an incentive to detain. The interrogations were harder to solve. Very late in the development, I decided that I needed a way to outright <b>require</b> the player to interrogate. That's nice but how?<br><br>Let me take you back to an early alpha:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1c8PADa.png" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Early alpha denial gating</i><br><br>That's a really old version (Check the bell and computer screen, also dithering), but it had a cool feature. You couldn't deny people until you found something wrong. It was a great way to gate your progress but ultimately felt <b>too</b> gamey so I took it out. Now I needed it back, only gooder. <br><br>Something that people (including me) said about the game was that "stamping is fun". I had a general desire to add another stamp somewhere and this ended up being the perfect place. I came up with the REASON FOR DENIAL stamp that appears only after you find and interrogate a discrepancy. If you want to deny somebody, you need a reason. Some nice things:<br><br><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
<li>It can be introduced midway through the game.</li>
<li>It changes how certain players play (those that never interrogate before denying).</li>
<li>It fits in with a nice story element (journalist complaints).</li>
<li>It lets players stamp more.</li>
<li>It adds more procedural rigamarole.</li>
<li>It looks bitchin.</li>
</ul>
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IoRmNl3.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>It even has a circuity-look to justify how it can be enabled only after interrogation. <b>Because of circuits.</b><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Additional Rulebook Pages</b></span><br>One of my mantras for the design in Papers Please was "keep it vague". That goes for both the story elements and the gameplay mechanics. I wanted the player to be overwhelmed at first and to have to feel their way through the interface and ruleset. Unfortunately, a common complaint from the beta was that things were too hard to figure out and weren't explained well. I really liked the idea of "winning" a labor lottery and being thrown into a job with no training though, so I was hesitant to fix this. Eventually, in the last few weeks before shipping, I decided to add a ton of pages to the rulebook to centralize what was previously a slew of scattered information.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nPuo2mF.png" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Detailed info on the Access Permit and its seals added to the rulebook</i><br><br>Previously, new mechanics were introduced in special bulletin pages. To help the player out, I was keeping these instructional pages in the bulletin for a few days after they first appeared. Things started piling up though and the bulletin got pretty bloated as a result. The proper long-term place for this stuff is in the rule book.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ITcCiuw.png" alt="" border="0"><br><i>Bulletin and rulebook version of the confiscation instructions</i><br><br>Important information is still introduced in the bulletin but it also gets a place in the rulebook and disappears from the bulletin on the next day. Doing it this way unified enough instructional material that I could actually be <i>more</i> vague in other areas. A lot of work near the end of the project but worth it.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>31st Day</b></span><br>Me, right after the beta: "The game will be 30 days." Later, I put in a supervisor encounter (Dimitri) every ten days and it was settled: the game would end on the 30th day after the last talk with your supervisor. Perfect.<br><br>When it came to actually lay out the story though, it was obvious that not everything would fit in 30 days. The biggest problem was too many events near the end game that required exclusivity.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/llKkKYN.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br>In particular, the final story pressure deals with illegally confiscating Obristan passports for your own family. Due to other events, the earliest I could introduce this pressure was on day 29. If the game is 30 days, that only gives you 2 days to get 5 passports; not enough.<br><br>One option was to cut more stuff to make it fit. But then I'd be removing completely finished encounters or events just to get a nice round number of days. Dumb reason so I extended everything by one day and the endgame events got just enough space to spread out well.<br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Not Completely Incompetent Guards</b></span><br>This is one of those things that took a rare moment of clarity to even notice. The guards in Arstotzka can't aim for shit. They missed every single time throughout the entire game, 8 attacks in all. This actually worked well with my desire to make the player responsible for stopping these attacks on their own with the sniper rifle. But really it makes no sense. These guys can't be that bad. <br><br>Honestly I didn't even consider this until coming back to tweak a terrorist attack after working on something else for a while. One of the benefits of doing code, design, art, music, and sound for a game is you often get a fresh look at old work. After noticing it, I quickly modified a few of the attacks to actually end with a guard stopping the terrorist(s). This was a case where I had to put game mechanics in the back seat just to keep the overall logic reasonable.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rOQ3n86.gif" alt="" border="0"><br><i>All that training, all those bullets</i><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Lots of Endings</b></span><br>Once the image+text style from the intro was recycled for the endings I had a good system for adding endings easily. This had a bigger effect than I expected. Now it made more sense production-wise to allow the player to do more things with more consequences. Instead of carrying player decisions through the entire game I could terminate things early with an ending. Or decisions that did carry through could have their own unique variation of a later ending. It sounds like a cheap trick but honestly the alternative was to not have these decision points at all.<br><br>I also felt like the endings didn't need a huge payoff. At least, not one that I could produce. Like most other things in the game, they're succinct and a little vague.<br><br>One thing that I think made these simplistic ending sequences more satisfying was the added music. Most of the gameplay takes place in near silence. There's only one song that plays during the title and night screens. By having two more songs just for the ending sequences the tone changes enough that it feels like more of a big deal than it objectively is.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CpAa9Ql.png" alt="" border="0"><br><br><i>Should be out soon.</i><br><br><hr>

<br>This is insane. First, the Channel 4 thing, which is really amazing. Then, nominations for best Indie and best PC game at the VGX. It's also in the running for best PC game at GameSpot. Nerd Cubed picked it as his GOTY, saying it was a "perfect game". With support from Russian fans, Papers Please made it to round 2 of the Escapist's GOTY brackets, where everything else is AAA. I've been speechless for days.<br><br>During this flurry, I've mostly kept my head down with work on the localizations. There's more postmortem stuff coming, I just gotta find the time to post it!

              It's been a crazy few weeks. First the BAFTAs and now IGF. I started this game as a small experiment and it's exploded beyond all of my expectations. Here's a recap:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9FaHR5y.jpg" alt="" border="0"><br><br>I have a bunch more postmortem stuff I want to finish; including a lot of detailed info on the localization process. That'll hopefully get posted over the next month or so while I'm taking a bit of a break. All the recent travel has really worn me out. After that I'll dive back into a new, smaller project.

              I've finally put together the localization postmortem. Unfortunately it was too big to post here so I put it up on tumblr instead. Tumblr has the same problem with big posts (only when trying to publish, previewing works for any size) but I had no energy to move it again.<br><br><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b><a href="http://dukope.tumblr.com/post/83177288060" target="_blank">&gt;&gt; Localizing <i>Papers, Please</i> &lt;&lt;</a></b></span></div>
